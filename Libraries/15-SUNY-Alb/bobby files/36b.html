<H3>Introduction</FONT></U></H3>
<P>Information is recorded in a variety of formats, including books and journals, film, magnetic media, 
and optical disk.  Print collections line the shelves of academic and research libraries, threatened by premature 
deterioration from being published on poor quality paper, careless handling, or inappropriate storage conditions. Electronic 
resources are also at risk, especially from software and hardware obsolescence and a lack of much needed standards to help 
ensure files are maintained for the long term. </P>

<P>With special state funding the University at Albany Libraries established 
        its own professionally staffed Preservation Department in 1987. The Department 
        is charged with coordinating efforts to prolong the useful life of the 
        University Libraries' collections and the information they contain through 
        in-house programs, vendor services and special cooperative projects with the ten other 
        major research libraries in the state. Preservation 
        Librarian Karen E.K. Brown is a professional paper conservator/librarian who joined the Library faculty 
        in the summer of 2001. </P>


<P>It is the responsibility of our research libraries to acquire information, organize it, make it available, and preserve it, 
regardless of format.  The University at Albany Libraries have a well established preservation program that is effectively 
dealing with resources in traditional formats and is currently working with others in the University community and beyond to 
provide, organize, and preserve scholarly electronic materials with the same long-term commitment. </P>
<H3>Preservation Activities</FONT></U></H3>

<P>As books begin to deteriorate physically, they are inspected by the staff of the Preservation Department.  Those having 
only minor structural damages may be rebound by a commercial bindery or repaired in-house. However, more sophisticated 
preservation treatment differs depending on whether an individiual item is valuable primarily for the information it contains or 
has significance as an art object or historical artifact.</P>

<P>Those with intrinsic value are likely to be transferred to the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections & Archives to insure proper 
storage and handling. </P>

<P>If the paper on which a book is printed has deteriorated to the point where its pages are too 
brittle to use without loss of information, or if a book is irreparable due to mold or vandalism, a decision is made by a 
library subject specialist about its value. Books which no longer have value for teaching or research are withdrawn from the 
collection.  Those still useful for research and study, but which have no historic or artistic value, may be replaced, or 
reformatted as a microfilm or preservation photocopy. Photocopied material that is no longer protected by U.S. Copyright law is now
scanned and made available as .pdf files through the Libraries' online catalog. Some volumes may be simply enclosed in a custom-made phase box or 
portfolio and returned to the shelf. 
<P>Futher information can be found on our <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Staff FAQs</FONT></U> page.
<H3>Care and Handling</FONT></U></H3>
<P>The longevity of books, even those printed on acidic paper, can be extended considerably by reducing the 
amount of physical stress to which they are subjected.  Some ways of doing this include providing adequate shelving; using bookends where necessary for support; maintaining 
stable temperature and humidity levels; and keeping the library clean.  Every library user can help prolong the useful 
life of the University Libraries' books by observing a few simple measures:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Be gentle.</LI>
<LI>Protect books from water.</LI>
<LI>Keep food and drink away.</LI>
<LI>Use a bookmark, rather than turning down the corners.</LI>
<LI>Take notes on scrap paper.</LI>
<LI>Do not force books open onto the copy machine.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you have questions about preventing damage to our collections, or should damage occur when you have materials checked out, our 
  <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Patron FAQs</FONT></U> can help.</P>
<P>The Preservation Laboratory is located on the third floor of the Science Library, SL310.  The staff is happy to 
assist if you have questions or problems regarding care of the collections.</P>

<H3>Staff Training</FONT></U></H3>
<P>The Preservation Department organizes staff training opportunities as problems or challenges arise. Our most recent program focused on first response to water emergencies in the Libraries, "<U><FONT COLOR=blue>The Preservation Poseidon Adventure</FONT></U>". We invite you to contact the Preservation Department if you have ideas or recommendations for future workshops.
