        <H2>About Our Program</H2>
	      <H3>How We Can Work With You</H3>
<P>Information literacy instruction is most effective when it is fully integrated into the goals of your class.</P>
	      <UL>
	        <LI>We can help you design an effective research assignment that introduces your students to the most useful, logistically feasible resources.</LI>
	        <LI>We can help you determine the most appropriate type of library instruction: class session, part of a class session, Web page, handout, tutorial, Learn@UW link, etc.</LI>
	        <LI>You can schedule library instruction to coincide with the time when students are working on their research assignments and are most motivated to learn.</LI>
	        <LI>We usually provide instruction in our library classrooms, but we can and will come to your classroom.</LI>
	        <LI>We know the information resources, but you know your students.  We need your presence and involvement in the planning and teaching of a library session to ensure that your students will be actively engaged.</LI>
	        <LI>With your help, we can stay in touch with your students to provide follow-up assistance after the library session through e-mail and individual consultations.</LI>
      </UL>
	      <H3>How We Do It</H3>
	      <P>The following goals guide the design of all instructional modules developed for our program:</P>
	      <UL>
	        <LI>Teach students to define their information needs, identify and select appropriate sources of information, and to evaluate these sources in terms of relevance, reliability, and objectivity.</LI>
	        <LI>Teach students strategies, as well as mechanical skills, for information seeking.</LI>
	        <LI>Teach students information seeking as a process that involves critical thinking and decision making.</LI>
	        <LI>Integrate hands-on learning techniques, including in-class exercises and database searching, using our computer-equipped classroom.</LI>
      </UL>
	      <H3>How to Get Started and Get More Information</H3>
	      <P>Effective library instruction takes time to prepare and is in great demand.  To ensure that your students will get the instruction they need when they need it, please contact us as far in advance as possible.</P>
        <P>See <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Scheduling a Library &amp; Information Literacy Instruction Session</FONT></U> or <U><FONT COLOR=blue> schedule or attend a library tour.</FONT></U></P>

      <H2>Tips for Designing Library Research Assignments</H2>
      <P>Well-designed course-related library assignments are an effective way to introduce students to library research.  </P>
       <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Guidelines for Positive Research Experience</FONT></U><BR>
                    </P>
                    
      <UL>
        <LI><EM>Address Learning  Goals Related to the Research Process.  </EM>Information  Literacy, the ability to find information and use it effectively to accomplish  a specific purpose, is included among the “Essential Learning Outcomes” for  students at UW-Madison.   Consider what  research skills you would like students to develop in completing the assignment  and discuss with your students the importance of developing those skills. </LI>
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <LI><EM>Be Clear about  Your Expectations.  </EM> Remember that your students may not have prior  experience with scholarly journals, monographs, or academic libraries.   Spend time in class discussing how research  is produced and disseminated in your discipline and how you expect your  students to participate in academic discourse in the context of your  class.  </LI>
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <LI><EM>Scaffolding your  Assignment Brings Focus to the Research Process.  </EM> Breaking a complex research assignment down  into a sequence of smaller, more manageable parts has a number of benefits: it  models how to approach a research question and effective time management, it gives  students the opportunity to focus on and master key research skills, it provides  opportunities for feedback, and it can be an effective deterrent to plagiarism. </LI>
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <LI><EM>Devote Class Time  to Discussion of the Assignment in Progress.    </EM>Periodic  discussions in class can help students reflect on the research process and its  importance, encourage questions, and help students develop a sense that what  they are doing is a transferable process that they can use for other  assignments.</LI>
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <LI><EM>Criteria for  Assessment.  </EM>In your criteria  for assessment (i.e. written instructions, rubrics), make expectations related  to the research process explicit.  For  example, are there specific expectations for the types of resources students  should use and how they should be cited?  <EM> </EM>Research shows that students tend to use  more scholarly sources when faculty provide them with clear guidelines  regarding the types of sources that should be used.</LI>
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <LI><EM>Test Your Assignment.  </EM>In testing an assignment yourself, you  may uncover practical roadblocks (e.g., too few copies of a book for too many  students, a source is no longer available online).   Librarians can help with testing your  assignment, suggest strategies for mitigating roadblocks (i.e. place books on  reserve for your students, suggest other resources), or design customized  supporting materials (i.e. handouts or web pages).  </LI>
      </UL>
      <UL>
        <LI><EM>Collaborate with  Librarians.  </EM>Librarians can  help you design an effective research assignment that helps students develop  the research skills you value and introduces your students to the most useful resources.  We also can work with you to develop and  teach a library instruction session for your students that will help them learn  the strategies they will need in order to complete your assignment.  </LI> </UL>

				  <h2>Designing an Assignment  Planning</h2>
                      <ol>
                        <li><strong>Consult with a librarian before the assignment.</strong><br />
Librarians will work with you to  design an appropriate assignment that will achieve your course goals/objectives. Send a copy of the assignment to your  Coordinator of Library and Information Literacy Instruction to ensure that the  library staff is ready to help your students.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assume minimal library knowledge.</strong><br />
Although many students may be familiar with Web search engines, few really understand the intricacies of subject headings or keyword searching used by most research databases. Most students have never used research journals, only popular magazines such as <em>Time</em> or <em>Newsweek.</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Explain the assignment clearly, preferably in writing.</strong><br />
Give students a clear idea of what the assignment involves, suggesting types of sources to be used. Give complete, accurate citations for specific works.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask librarians for help with sources.</strong><br />
Librarians can help instructors  with assignments by providing a list of useful sources, or types of sources. The librarian can help you verify whether the particular sources you had in mind are available at the UW libraries. Librarians will also be aware of any new resources that might be useful for your students.</li></ol>
				  </div>
				  
				  <div id="topics">
				  <h2>Designing an Assignment  Topics</h2>
				  <ol>
				    <li><strong>Avoid very current topics or local topics.</strong><br />
If your assignment requires students to locate scholarly articles on their topic, remember that very current topics and local topics may only appear in newspapers or popular magazines. In some cases there may be little or nothing published about the topic.</li>

				    <li><strong>Avoid topics that are too general.</strong><br />
Some topics are too general and will retrieve an unmanageable number of sources or may retrieve  sources that are not specific to a student's topic. Encourage your students to write a research  question, which will help them focus their topic. The phrase &ldquo;water pollution&rdquo; is too general;  the question &ldquo;What are the pollutants in urban runoff?&rdquo; is more specific.</li>

				    <li><strong>Avoid topics that are too specific</strong><br />
Some topics are so specific that there is little or no published information. For example, &ldquo;What environmental problems will be caused by the Crandon Mine?&rdquo; is so specific that information may be limited to newspapers. This question could be expanded to &ldquo;What environmental problems are caused by copper mining?&rdquo;</li></ol>
				  </div>
				  
				  <div id="logistics">
				  <h2>Designing an Assignment  Logistics</h2>
				  <ol>
				  <li><strong>Test your library assignment by doing it yourself.</strong><br />
Sometimes an  assignment that looks great on paper doesn't work well in practice. It may require students to have research skills they have not been taught. Also, the assignment may need more detailed instructions or require the use of resources that go beyond the objectives covered in the library instruction module of the course. Whatever the reason, sometimes a library assignment does not work. It is good to know that before you give it to your students.</li>

				  <li><strong>Always be sure the library has the needed material or source.</strong><br />
There are few experiences more frustrating than looking for something that does not exist, (e.g. has been checked out, has been replaced with a different title, or has not been published.) Use the library's Course Reserves service for material that many students need to use. Send a list of required resources to your Coordinator of Library &amp; Information Literacy Instruction to verify that those sources exist.</li>

				    <li><strong>Avoid the mob scene.</strong><br />
Dozens of students using one book, article, or index, or looking for the same information usually  leads to misplacement, loss, or mutilation of materials. It also can frustrate students by preventing them from completing the assignment. Allow students to choose from a variety of topics and sources. Use Course Reserves when a particular source is required.</li>

				    <li><strong>Avoid scavenger hunts.</strong><br />
Searching for obscure facts frustrates students, can cause chaos in the library stacks, and  teaches students little about research. If planning a library exercise, talk to your Coordinator of Library &amp; Information Literacy Instruction about designing one appropriate to the class.</li>

				    <li><strong>Be clear in your use of the term &ldquo;Internet.&rdquo;</strong><br />
If your students are asked to use the Internet as a source of information, it is important to clarify what they should use. Many library licensed journal databases and fulltext sources are available through the Internet and could be considered Internet sources. Do you want your students to find authoritative Web sites or use library resources?</li>

				    <li><strong>Refer students to library staff for help.</strong><br />
Remind students that librarians and other library staff are available at reference and information desks and can provide individual help. Even students who have had a library instruction session may need additional help.</li></ol>
