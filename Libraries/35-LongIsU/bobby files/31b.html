<P>In 1969, the Long Island University elected Mrs. Carleton (Winthrop B.) 
Palmer to its Board of Trustees. Winthrop replaced her husband, who 
resigned from the Board due to health reasons after having served
 in this position for over seventeen years.


<P>[ ]
During her first-year as a trustee, Mrs. Palmer was asked to Chair the 
Library Committee for the three centers of Long Island University.   
As Chair she originated the idea of the Post Library Association.  
Winthrop gathered together  several North Shore of Long Island  residents 
to discuss her plans and these eight members became known as the 
founders.  The original founders were: Mrs. Carleton B. Palmer,  Mrs. 
Hoffman Nickerson, Mrs. Franz Schneider, Mrs. Fred Haggerson, Mrs. Ewing 
Reilley, Mrs. James Cecil, Prof. E. Hugh Behymer and Dr. Donald L. 
Ungarelli.

<P>	The Board of Trustees approved the Post Library Association plan and 
the first meeting of the PLA Executive Council was held on January 5, 
1970.  Mrs. Carleton Palmer served as chairman and council members 
were: Mrs. Jo H. Chamberlin, Mrs. Innis O’Rourke Jr., Mrs. Richard 
Griffith, Mrs. Lisa Collado Ford, Mrs. Hoffman Nickerson, Mrs. Franz 
Schneider, Mrs. Fred Haggerson, Mrs. Ewing Reilley, Mr. John Bernard 
Myers, Mrs. James Cecil. Another member,  Mr. Vincent Macri, secretary 
of the University’s Board of  Trustees, wrote the by-laws and served 
as the  first secretary of the PLA.


<P> The Post Library Association was devoted to planning many 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>cultural and educational functions</FONT></U> 
for the C. W. Post Campus Library  (B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library) 
of L.I.U.  The long, T-shaped marble hall on the lower level of the B. 
Davis Schwartz Memorial Library was  remodeled in order to make it more 
conducive for use as a gallery.  Carleton and  Winthrop Palmer engaged 
craftsmen to redesign the walls and lighting.  The first exhibit 
arranged by Winthrop featured Mexican lithography and displays of poetry 
and prose.  The guest speaker was Professor Rubin Arango of  C. W Post’s 
Foreign Language Department.


<P>In 1973, the <EM>PLA Report</EM> began as a joint venture between the 
Post Library Association and the Library.  This beautifully illustrated 
magazine contained book reviews, poetry, and scholarly articles written 
by the University faculty and members of the local communities.  Its 
editor-in-chief, Joan Huntoon, was a PLA Council member who had been in 
the publishing field and volunteered her services for this venture.  
The <EM>PLA Report</EM> was widely circulated to all types of libraries in 
Nassau and Suffolk Counties.

<P>
In the quarter century that the Post Library Association has been in 
existence it has contributed greatly to the cultural life on the campus 
in general and in the Library specifically.  
The more than 300 <U><FONT COLOR=blue>member families</FONT></U> have 
generously donated their time and energy to many events that not only 
improve the collections of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library but 
they have contributed thousands of dollars to library scholarship funds 
and poetry awards.   Waldo Hutchins, a PLA Council member, contributed 
a generous  gift to refurbish the library gallery.  His gift allowed 
the Library to have the walls, lighting, and alarm system redesigned, 
and  the gallery was renamed the Waldo Hutchins Gallery in 1980.  The 
Hutchins Gallery  has become a showcase of fine art with its wide variety 
of beautiful <U><FONT COLOR=blue>art exhibits</FONT></U>.  Exhibits 
sponsored by the PLA have been uniformly praised for their high quality.
 
<P>The PLA &quot;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Friday Night Programs</FONT></U>&quot;, 
a dinner and lecture series, have attracted a wide array of nationally 
and internationally renowned scholars.  Other events sponsored by the 
PLA include the annual <U><FONT COLOR=blue>book sale</FONT></U>, various 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>booktalks</FONT></U>, <U><FONT COLOR=blue>poetry 
readings</FONT></U> and <U><FONT COLOR=blue>special events</FONT></U>, such as 
museum and opera trips.  The Post 
Library Association has a long history of service to the LIU academic 
community with their  many literary and artistic endeavors, and 
they continue to expand and evolve as an 
organization dedicated to the betterment of the Library and the University.

<P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Special Collections</FONT></U> 
department of the library 
is traditionally where the Eugene and Carlotta O'Neill Library, the 
William Randolph Hearst Art Archives, original 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>movie posters</FONT></U> from the 
1940's and 1950's, and the Theodore Roosevelt Collection resides.  But in 
recent years, and following the original strictures of Mrs. Winthrop 
Palmer's generous gift to the library, much rare Irish and French 
literature has been acquired.  Although they have concentrated on the 
Nobel Prize-winning avant-garde writer, Samuel Beckett, an Irishman who 
wrote both in French and English, they have collected rare items of 
many writers from varying literary periods, both French and Irish. 
This collection has grown, in just a few years, to over a thousand titles. 
It includes a manuscript of eighteen year-old Simone de Beauvoir, 
the first edition of Joyce's <EM>Ulysses</EM>, and significant rarities 
by Yeats, O'Flaherty, Wilde, George Moore, Shaw, French surrealist and 
symbolist poets, Seamus Heaney and other 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>contemporary Irish poets</FONT></U>, 
and many 
others, both well known and little known.
