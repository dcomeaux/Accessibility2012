<EM>Information for Faculty</EM></CENTER>


<P>ERes from Docutek is an easy to use Electronic Reserve system. Using ERes, faculty 
 can offer their students access 
 to reserve materials online. The readings are password-accessible to students on or off-campus. 
 If you have questions please contact the library. 


<P>All faculty and staff using this system must read the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Copyright, Fair Use, and ERes</FONT></U>
information below. Faculty who wish to have library materials placed 
 on ERes can download the &quot;Electronic Reserve Request Form&quot; 
 and submit the completed form to the Circulation desk in the library. Individual 
 faculty are responsible for obtaining permission from publishers for materials 
 that do not comply with <EM>Fair Use.</EM> Form letters for permission from 
 publishers can be downloaded below.

<P><HR><BR><EM>Copyright, Fair Use, and 
ERes</FONT></U></EM>

<P>Course materials that can be placed on electronic reserve without restrictions 
include materials you created for your class and materials in the public domain (see 
below). It 
is recommended that you password your course page(s) so that only your students have 
access. All course pages that contain copyrighted material MUST be password protected. 


<P><EM>Copyrighted Works</EM><BR>
A work is considered copyrighted if it is original and is in a fixed medium. Most 
published material, not in the public domain, is copyrighted. A work does not need to be 
registered with the U. S. Copyright Office in order to be copyrighted. It is automatically 
copyrighted if it meets the originality and fixed medium requirements. Under this 
definition, even unpublished works, material found on web pages, and students' papers 
can meet the originality requirement. Student papers are also protected by the <EM>Family 
Education Rights and Privacy Act</EM> and cannot be placed on electronic reserve without 
permission. 

<P><EM>Fair Use</EM><BR>
U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17 of U.S. Code) grants exclusive rights to the owners 
of copyrighted work to determine if and how their works are reproduced and used. 
However, limitations to these exclusive rights as they pertain to the educational use of 
materials are provided in the Fair Use doctrine. Fair Use allows for the reproduction of 
copyrighted work without permission but only if the following criteria are considered: 

<OL>
<LI>The <EM>purpose</EM> and character of the use, including whether such use is of a 
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; 
<LI>The <EM>nature</EM> of the copyrighted work; 
<LI>The <EM>amount</EM> and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted 
work;  
<LI>The <EM>effect</EM> of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted 
work. 
</OL>

<P>In light of these four criteria, it is important to keep in mind: 
<UL>
<P><LI>All four criteria need to be applied and balanced. 
<P><LI>Nonprofit educational use favors Fair Use. 
<P><LI>Works of fiction and other creative works such as visual art and music, generally, do 
not meet Fair Use criteria #2. 
<P><LI>Generally, there is a one-semester limitation for reserve material; however, the above 
criteria of Fair Use still apply. 
<P><LI>If the library owns a copy of the work in question, that favors granting Fair Use in light 
of criteria #3 and #4. 
<P><LI>The amount of a work (i.e. chapters of a book) needs to be balanced with the effect on 
the market value. 
<P><LI>There is no set percentage to follow, but the amount of a work needs to be factored in 
with the other criteria, particularly #4. 
<P><LI>Linking to a full-text article in one of the library's licensed full-text databases is 
preferable to scanning a print article and uploading it to electronic reserve. However, you 
must be certain that the journal is available in a database, the database is accessible 
off-campus, users can be authenticated as Long Island University students, and the links are 
durable or persistent. If you need assistance locating online full-text journals and creating 
durable links, please contact the Reference Department (x2305) in the library. 
<P><LI>The library retains the right to determine if materials placed on electronic reserve meet 
a reasonable interpretation of Fair Use criteria. If materials do not meet the criteria, then 
the appropriate permissions will be sought from the copyright owners or the materials 
will be removed. 
</UL>


<P>Additional information concerning Fair Use can be found in the U.S. Copyright Office 
Publication Circular 21 - <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Reproduction of 
Copyrighted Works by Educators and 
Librarians</FONT></U> (pdf format).  


<P><EM>Public Domain</EM><BR>
Works in the public domain are free to use without limitations. All works published 
before 1923 are considered in the public domain. Works produced by government 
employees are generally in the public domain, although there can be exceptions. 


<P><EM>Obtaining Permission: When and How</EM><BR>
If the materials you are placing on electronic reserve do not fall within Fair Use, you 
must obtain permission from the publisher. You can obtain form letters from the library 
or the links above. It is recommended 
that requests for permission from the publisher be done well in advance of 
placing materials on electronic reserves. Publishers are slow to respond and several 
requests may be necessary. 

<P>It is the responsibility of each instructor to obtain permission for any materials placed on 
electronic reserve that do not meet Fair Use criteria and to make arrangements for the 
payment of any fees imposed by the publisher.
