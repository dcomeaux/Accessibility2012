<P><EM>How Do I Find a Book?</EM> 



<P>Use <U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>LIUCat</EM></FONT></U>: 
Long Island University's online public access catalog. 

<UL>

<LI>What is &quot;List Search&quot;? 
	<UL>
	<LI>Use <EM>List search</EM> (also called Browse) 
if you know the author or title you want. Be creative 
when thinking of ways authors and titles can be misspelled 
or rearranged (e.g. Frankel / Frankle / Franckel or 
Pudd'inhead Wilson or Nietzsche,&nbsp;Friedrich). It takes you to 
an alphabetical list you can browse. (<U><FONT COLOR=blue>More Information</FONT></U>)
	</UL>



<P>
<LI>What is &quot;Keyword Search&quot;? 
	<UL>
	<LI>Use <EM>Keyword</EM> if you have a general topic or subject. 
It finds the word <EM>anywhere</EM> in the title, author, description, 
or subject (unless you specify just one of these fields). (<U><FONT COLOR=blue>More Information</FONT></U>)
	</UL>



<P>
<LI>Does the library have everything listed in LIUCat?
	<UL>
	<LI>All of the campus libraries of LIU are included 
in the computer, so make sure the book you want is 
here at C.W. Post. It may also be in one of the departments  
(rather than the circulating stacks),  checked 
out, or on <U><FONT COLOR=blue>reserve</FONT></U>. 
	</UL>


<P>
<LI>Where in the building should I go?
	<UL>
	<LI>Look at the first letter of the call number to 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>find the    
stack level</FONT></U> on which the book is shelved, or go 
to the proper department. A printed guide to the bookstacks 
is also available. You will need a 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>picture ID</FONT></U> to enter stacks. 
	<LI><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Reserve books</FONT></U> 
are usually kept at the Circulation Desk. 
	</UL>

<P>
<LI>I can't find the book, but the computer says it's not checked out.
	<UL>
	<LI>If a book is not on the shelf or you can't find it, a 
librarian can accompany you to the stacks to help you locate it. 
Be creative when you try to think how it might be misshelved. 
Also, check the pre-sorting/pre-shelving area on 
each stack level as well as the Circulation Desk.
	</UL>

<P>
<LI>What if my book <EM>is</EM> checked out?
	<UL>
	<LI>If a book is actually checked out, you can put a 
	<EM>hold</EM> on it at the Circulation Desk.
	</UL>

<P>
<LI>Can I get a book from another campus?
	<UL>
	<LI>If book is at another campus, you can order it on 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan</FONT></U>.
	</UL>



 </FONT></U>
<P>
<LI>Can I get the full text of books online? 
	<UL>
	<LI>The library subscribes to <EM>ebrary</EM>, which contains the text of approximately 44,000 
books. ebrary books are included in LIUCat and will appear in your search results with the phrase 
&quot;<EM>[electronic resource]</EM>&quot; after the title. 
		<UL>
		<LI>Click on the title and then the ebrary link to access it. You will need to install the 
		ebrary reader (available from the ebrary website) on your computer to view it. 
		<LI>To search for only ebrary books, do a <U><FONT COLOR=blue>keyword search</FONT></U> 
		and type &quot;ebrary&quot; after your search terms. 
		<LI>You can also search directly from the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>ebrary website</FONT></U>. 
		This will let you search through the full text of books as well. If you want to search by subject 
		headings instead of through the full text, LIUCat will have better indexing.
		<LI><U><FONT COLOR=blue>More information</FONT></U>.
		</UL>
	<LI>The library also subscribes to both the <EM>Gale Virtual Reference Library</EM> which contains 
the full text of 370 encyclopedias and other reference books and <EM>Credo Reference</EM> with the full text of an 
additional 432. You can search through all of them at once or 
choose a particular one. They are listed on the database page under 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Reference Books</FONT></U> as well as by 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>specific subject headings</FONT></U>. The library subscribes to a 
number of other reference books that can also be accessed this way. 

	</UL>



 </FONT></U>
<P>
<LI>The book I want isn't listed. 
<LI>Is the book in another library? 
<LI>Do I have the title right?
	<UL>
	<LI><EM>To verify the existence of a book</EM>, 
use the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>WorldCat</FONT></U> 
database from OCLC.  WorldCat searches every major library in the 
country but not the smaller, public ones. 
<LI>You can also check the online catalogs of 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>local libraries</FONT></U>. Nassau County residents 
may use any Nassau public library; Suffolk County residents may 
use any Suffolk public library. Also, the LILRC Research Loan 
Program will enable you to check books out of a number of 
Long Island libraries.  Ask for help in the 
Reference Department.

<UL>

<LI>What are databases?
	<UL>
	<LI>Databases index periodicals so that you can 
locate articles on a specific topic without being 
forced to browse through them issue by issue. 
	<LI>Some databases contain <U><FONT COLOR=blue>books and encyclopedias</FONT></U>. 
	<LI>Some databases provide other information such as 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>statistics</FONT></U> or 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>company financials</FONT></U>.
	</UL>


<P>
<LI>What databases do you have?
	<UL>
	<LI>An <U><FONT COLOR=blue>alphabetic list of 
databases</FONT></U> is on the library's website. A list of databases 
by <U><FONT COLOR=blue>vendor</FONT></U> is also available. 
	<LI>When you select one of these, the link may take 
you to a list of all the databases offered by that company. 
Select the database you want from their list. 
	</UL>


<P>
<LI>How do I choose a database for my subject? 
	<UL>
	<LI>The best place to start is the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>list of databases by subject</FONT></U>. 
	<LI>Select the broad subject area from the 
list, and read the database descriptions to see which 
ones would be most useful to you. 
	</UL>


<P>
<LI>I'm still not sure.
	<UL>
	<LI>The databases listed under 
&quot;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>General</FONT></U>&quot; 
contain articles about almost every subject. Try one of 
these if you're not sure. 
	<LI><EM>Academic OneFile</EM>,   
<EM>ProQuest Research Library</EM>, and 
<EM>Academic Search Premier</EM> are good choices.
	<LI>Keep in mind that the more specialized subject 
databases will provide more comprehensive coverage of their 
subjects than these general ones will.
	</UL>


<P>
<LI>Where can I access the databases? 
	<UL>
	<LI>You can access almost every database from any 
university computer - library, computer labs, dorm rooms, 
offices, etc. - so long as it is hooked into the university's 
computer network. 
	<LI>A few databases are available only from library 
computers and are marked with this graphic: 
[Library computers only] 
	</UL>


<P>
<LI>Can I access the databases from home?
	<UL>
	<LI>See: <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Remote Access</FONT></U>.
	</UL>


<P>
<LI>Do the databases contain the full text of articles or <U><FONT COLOR=blue>books</FONT></U>?
	<UL>
	<LI>Databases that contain full text are marked 
with this graphic: 
[Full text available]. 
Most of the databases 
we subscribe to offer at least some amount of full text online by clicking 
the link, but only a small percentage of all the periodicals that 
exist can be accessed this way. In many cases, the database will 
just provide a citation to an article. 
	<LI>If you are looking for a particular periodical in a database, see: 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Can I get the text of articles online?</FONT></U> 
	</UL>



<P>
<LI>What if I find an article listed in a database, and there's no text?</FONT></U>
	<UL>
	<LI>Many of the databases that do not contain the full text themselves <EM>will</EM> include 
a link that says something like: 
&quot;<EM>Check LinkSource for Full-Text</EM>&quot; or 
&quot;<EM>Find Alternate Full-Text</EM>&quot; or 
&quot;<EM>Check for Full-Text availability</EM>&quot; or 
&quot;<EM>Find a copy</EM>&quot;. 
When you click this link, it will look to see if the full text 
of that journal is available in one of our other databases using our 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>LIU Online, Print, and Microform 
Journal Holdings</FONT></U> page. If it is available, a new window will pop up with the article from the 
appropriate database. If an error message appears instead of the text, click the 
&quot;Check additional full-text sources in other LIU databases&quot; link at the top, and it will give you a list of 
links to every database that contains the article or let you know if we have the hardcopy version. 
	</UL>

<LI>If that says &quot;Sorry, no holdings were found for this journal&quot;, then where can I get it? 
	<UL>
	<LI>See: <U><FONT COLOR=blue>How do I find a periodical?</FONT></U> 
	</UL>


<P>
<LI>Can I print out  my articles or citations? 
	<UL>
	<LI>Library computers are networked to a 
printer in each department (computers in the Bibliographic 
Instruction room print to the Reference Department printer). 
	<LI>Follow the printing instructions in each database, 
instead of just clicking the &quot;print&quot; button, and 
then go to the service desk. 
	<LI><EM>Do not exit the database until you are sure your 
printout is ok</EM>. 
	<LI>Printouts of citations are free. 
	<LI>Printouts of full text cost ten cents per page in the 
library departments. The Computer Labs will let you print out up to 
twenty pages for free. 
	</UL>



<P>
<LI>Can I <U><FONT COLOR=blue>email</FONT></U> my articles or citations 
to myself or save them to a disk or flash drive? 
	<UL>
	<LI>Many databases will let you do this. Ask if you need 
help. 
	<LI>Emails and saved files might not include 
illustrations, tables, or graphs that were part of the article.

	<UL>
	<LI>Go to <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Literature</FONT></U>

<LI>Can I get a book or article from another campus?
	<UL>
	<LI>Yes, but it might 
take a week or two even if the book is on the shelf at the other 
campus. Circulation records are not uniformly indicated in 
LIUCat for other campuses. In some instances, that determines 
whether or not we can proceed with an interlibrary loan. If it is not
