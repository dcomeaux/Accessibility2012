Presenters: <EM>Eric Lease Morgan and Marshall Breeding</EM><BR>
Location:<EM>Library Instruction Lab, room 220</EM>
<P>Librarians know that the target of keeping technology current is always moving, and 
budgets are static at best. Each year, College of DuPage teleconferences dedicates one program 
that takes a look at future technology trends and gives librarians an important basis for their planning 
efforts. Libraries are both adopters and innovators, and are increasingly looking beyond the library 
environment for technological innovations and solutions.

Presenters: <EM>Dr. Lisa Stock, Dr. Jean Donham and Dane Ward</EM><BR>
Location:<EM>Library Instruction Lab, room 220</EM>
<P>When President Barack Obama declared October 2009 as National Information 
Literacy Awareness Month, Information Literacy received national attention. The 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>declaration</FONT></U> 
stated: &quot;In addition to the basic skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic, it is equally 
important that our students are given the tools required to take advantage of the information 
available to them.&quot; He asked &quot;people of the United States to recognize the important 
role that information plays in our daily lives, and appreciate the need for a greater 
understanding of its impact.&quot;
<P>In this context, <EM>Lisa Stock</EM>, Dean of Learning Resources at College of DuPage, 
<EM>Jean Donham</EM>, Associate Professor in School Library Studies at the University of Northern Iowa 
Division of School Library Studies and the Department of Curriculum and Instruction, and 
<EM>Dane Ward</EM>, Dean of Public Services at Illinois State University's Milner Library, will give a 
background briefing on the working standards and assessments for national literacy and open a dialog on 
what librarians can do to strengthen efforts to encourage and build information literacy efforts not only in 
your own library, but in concert with your colleagues around the country.
<P>Light refreshments will be served but in the spirit of a true brown bag feel free to bring your lunch.

<EM>360 Search</EM><BR>
<DD>The Library's TERC (Technology &amp; Electronic Resources Committee) would like to 
get together to discuss and help familiarize you all with the newest addition to our electronic 
arsenal - Serial Solutions <EM>360 Search</EM>.
<P>360 Search is a federated product designed to assist students and researchers in searching 
across multiple interfaces at once. Our main goal in implementing this product is to help users to 
make better use of the databases we license. 
<P>Presently, we are looking to enlist your assistance in experimenting with the functionality of the 
interface. We are planning to survey users of 360 Search throughout the Spring Semester so that we 
can receive greater input on how to more fully harness the power of federated searching here on the 
C.W. Post Campus. 
<P>Please come - your input and professional expertise are needed to assist us in enhancing the 
value of this research tool. Light refreshments will be served - but, in the spirit of a true brown bag, 
please feel free to bring your lunch.

<EM>Clickers in the Classroom: Using Student Response Systems to Promote Active Learning</EM><BR>
<DD>Ingrid Wang, librarian and Coordinator of Technology and Information Services at our 
Brooklyn Campus will be on hand to lead a demonstration and discussion on Student 
Response Systems (SRS's) also known as &quot;clickers&quot;. Clickers are student-held 
transmitters that work with classroom receivers to record student answers to short questions, 
capture student opinions, and help instructors quickly assess whether students understand 
the main points of the day's class instruction. Clickers have become standard equipment in 
many college classrooms because of their ability to provide a more active learning environment 
and appraisal of student learning.<BR>
<DD>Coffee and light refreshments will be served. However, in the spirit at a true brown bag feel 
free to bring your lunch. <BR>
<DD><EM>Friday, September 26, 2008 from 11:00 to 12:00, Library Room 220</EM>




<P><DT><EM>June 18, 2008 -</EM> 
<EM>Got Game? : Libraries and Games</EM><BR>
<DD><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Dona McDermott</FONT></U> 
will lead a discussion on the use of games in 
library instruction. Game Studies have indicated that there is a genuine interest 
in and potential for libraries and librarians to use games for instruction. Two of the 
games discussed will be Library Bingo (it's not the old folks version in the church 
basement) and the Cephalonian Method. Let's get together to explore this topic 
further and talk about how we might tap into our users' interests in games to teach 
library and research-related theory. Come and get your game on!<BR>
<DD><EM>Wednesday, June 18 from 11:00 a.m. to noon in the Library Instruction Room, Lib 220.</EM>




<P><DT><EM>April 11, 2008 -</EM> 
<EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Trends, 
Fads or Folly: Spotting Library Trends That Matter</FONT></U></EM><BR>
<DD>In surveying the library landscape and the technological trends that impact this landscape, 
it's easy to identify new technologies that &quot;could&quot; be used by libraries to improve or 
enhance service. This program will explore some of these trends like patron-created folksonomic 
cataloging (del.icio.us, LibraryThing, and the new breed of OPAC's), 
libraries and librarians in virtual environments (such as Second Life), and provide an update on 
libraries and social networks (MySpace and Facebook). The main focus of the presentation will be 
a discussion on the extent to which libraries need to quickly incorporate these new technologies 
into their programming. Or rather, &quot;Just because you can do it... does that mean that you should?&quot; 
<P><EM>Friday, April 11, 2008 from 12:00 to 1:00, Library Instruction Lab, Room 220</EM>
<P>Please arrive a few minutes early as the program will begin promptly at noon. Coffee and a

<DD>SirsiDynix has announced a plan to release a new integrated technology 
platform called Rome. This release is slated to take place sometime late in 2008. 
Unfortunately, this shift on the part of our vendor raises serious questions and concerns 
regarding their intentions to support Horizon now and in the future. As a result, we 
strongly encourage librarians and interested others to attend a webinar given by 
SirsiDynix. This webinar will provide us an 
opportunity to begin exploring the impact of this change on our library.<BR>

best friend - assisting us in serving our patrons and many 
times helping us do our jobs better.  However, as the World Wide 
Web continues to grow at an exponential rate and many of us 
feel overwhelmed, have you ever wished that everything could be 
simpler?  Do you sometimes long for a list of web sites that 
would get you through the most challenging of workdays? If you 
answered yes to either of these questions, then 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>The Best from the Web</FONT></U> 
is for you. Kelly Watson and a panel of experts have 
compiled a toolkit of the best the web has to offer library workers. 
Learn about web resources that will assist you in your everyday 
job, whether you work at a public desk or behind the scenes in 
tech services. Leave this session with your 'best of the web' toolkit 
and make your job of providing the best information for your 
patrons easier.&quot;

technological orientation of our discourse, such as &quot;The 
Wherewithal of Wireless&quot; and &quot;Chance Favors the 
Prepared Mind: Notes on Database Utilities.&quot; 

<P>All persons on campus are invited to attend T-Time.  Look for 
postings on this site for future programs. For more information,

 <EM>~Ogden Nash~</EM><BR>
<DD>Our Spring 2004 <EM>T-Time</EM> will focus on the pragmatics of library photoduplication.

From bound book to sound byte, we'll get a nuts-n-bolts orientation on the current provisions 
for library duplication; get the skinny on existing policies that direct or printing and data-capturing practices 
(Adobe, ProQuest, and others); and discuss future initiatives for better assisting students and faculty 
in the effective transference of printed and online information.

<EM>Chance Favors the Prepared Mind : Notes on Database Utilities</EM><BR>
<DD>Did you know that our library currently offers over 200 general 
and specialized databases and that 56 have been added over 
the last six months? In this high-tech, hunt-n-peck world, consortia 
subscriptions wax and wane; vendors aggregate their 
electronic products; students scream for full-text; and librarians try 
to keep up with amorphous information products and 
services. Join us for this colloquial discussion. Among the database 
utilities we pay for, how are we using them? How are we 
teaching them? What hidden features might our serendipitous 
adventures reveal? This symposium will include the following topics:
<UL>
<LI><EM>Finding Online Versions of Our Journals</EM>, Larry Kirschenbaum
<LI><EM>WebSpirs ERIC</EM>, Jackie Elsas

<DD>Since we are one of the first 
college campuses on Long Island with wireless connectivity, 
we thought this would be a timely topic for T-time. Ali Atieh, 
C.W. Post's Chief Information Officer, will 
speak to us on the freedom and portability of wireless and 
the exciting prospects for teaching in traditionally unwired 
locations (such as the Great Lawn). <BR>
