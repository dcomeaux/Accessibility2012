<CENTER><EM>Circulation / Reserve</EM></CENTER>


<P>All library materials are checked out at the <EM>Circulation/Reserve 
Desk</EM> in the main lobby except for materials in the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Instructional Media Center</FONT></U>. Materials in 
Reference Services, Special Collections and Archives, Periodicals, the 
Digital Initiatives and Art Slide Library and Reserve are for reference use only 
and may not leave the building. 

<P>Your <EM>Long Island University I.D. card</EM> also serves as your library 
card. A free library card is available to Brookville residents. Please 
bring your card with you whenever you wish to use library materials. 
To obtain your card: 

<P><EM>Students, Faculty, and Staff:</EM> go to the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Public Safety Department</FONT></U> 
located in the Facilities Services building, 299-2214. 
For their hours and updated information, access the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Photo ID Information</FONT></U> 
link. 


<P><EM>Alumni:</EM> Go to the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Office of Development and Alumni Relations</FONT></U>, 
located in the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Kahn Discovery Center</FONT></U>, Suite 100, 
299-2263. 
Then go to the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Public Safety Department</FONT></U>. 

<P><EM>Brookville Residents:</EM> go to the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Office of Community 
Relations</FONT></U>, located in the Administration Building, room 210, 299-3500, or email 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>neighbor@liu.edu</FONT></U>. 

<P><EM>Post Library Association:</EM> go to the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>PLA Membership</FONT></U> 
page. The PLA Office is located in the Library, room 133, 299-2892 

<P><EM>LIU card holders</EM> (students, faculty, and staff) have access to 
everything: borrowing privileges, <U><FONT COLOR=blue>databases</FONT></U>, and 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>interlibrary loan</FONT></U>. 

<P><EM>Alumni</EM>, Continuing Education students, PLA members, and Brookville residents are allowed 
borrowing privileges, with an LIU card, but no access to databases or 
interlibrary loan. 

<P><EM>Theses</EM> students or students with an <EM>incomplete</EM> must get a Thesis Card from 
the Circulation desk and have it filled out by their department. Circulation will keep the card on 
file, and the student must bring their ID card when checking out books. 


<P><BR><EM>Barcodes</EM><BR>
In order to have access, the staff at the <EM>Circulation/Reserve Desk</EM> 
will apply a barcode to your I.D. card when you fill out a 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Patron Registration Form</FONT></U>. 
If you already have a barcode, fill out the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Expired Registration 
Form</FONT></U>. If you fill out these forms ahead of time, bring them to the Circulation/Reserve Desk. 


<P><BR><EM>Update your Barcode</EM><BR>
Students need to update their barcode each Fall and in the Summer if 
they are taking classes. Staff need to update their cards annually. 
Adjunct Faculty have to renew their account each term. To 
find out if your barcode is expired, go to the Online Public Access 
Catalog (<U><FONT COLOR=blue>LIUCat</FONT></U>), 
click on the 
&quot;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>My Account</FONT></U>&quot; 
tab, and proceed to the 
&quot;Profile&quot; tab. To update your account, go to the Circulation/Reserve 
Desk. 


<P><BR><EM>My Account tab</EM><BR>
From the &quot;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>My Account</FONT></U>&quot; 
tab, you can see the books you currently have out, 
renew books once (as long as they are not overdue), check for any 
library blocks, including when your card will expire, and check the status 
of hold requests (<U><FONT COLOR=blue>more information about viewing your account</FONT></U>). 
When you are finished, be sure to log out and close the browser. 


<P><BR><EM>Lost Cards</EM><BR>
Students must pay $10.00 at the Bursar's Office before going to the Public Safety department for a new card. 


<P><BR></FONT></U><EM>Loan Period</EM><BR>
Books may be borrowed for <EM>28 days</EM>. Staff may borrow books for 120 days. 
The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Instructional Media Center</FONT></U> has different loan periods. 
Renewals are permitted once online, assuming the book is not overdue. 
Click on the &quot;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>My Account</FONT></U>&quot; 
tab.  Any further renewals must be done in person at the Circulation Desk. 


<P><BR></FONT></U><EM>Fines</EM><BR>
Overdue fines are 10 cents per day with a seven day grace period. 
However, on the eighth day, the 
fine for the full eight days will be owed. Please request a receipt when 
returning books. 


<P><BR></FONT></U><EM>Holds and Interlibrary Loans</EM><BR>
To place a book on hold, it must be done in person and the book status must be checked out. 
Please note that LIUCat contains the holdings of <EM>all</EM> of Long Island University's 
campuses, not just C.W. Post. If you need a book from another 
campus, it can be requested through the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan Office</FONT></U>. 


<P><BR></FONT></U><EM>Reserve Collection</EM><BR>
Materials on reserve consist primarily of books and articles that have been requested by 
faculty for the use of their students. Most of this material is held at the Circulation/Reserve 
Desk in the main lobby. All reserve material is for reference use only and may not be taken out. 

<P>Articles are placed on <U><FONT COLOR=blue>electronic reserve</FONT></U> 
(ERes) so that students may 
access them over the internet. For more information, see 
&quot;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>A Student 
Guide to Electronic Reserve</FONT></U>&quot; and 
&quot;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Getting Started with ERes: 
Information for Faculty</FONT></U>&quot;. 

<P>Faculty wishing to place a book on reserve should fill out a 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Book Request Form</FONT></U> (DOC) 
<EM><EM>at least one month prior to when the items will be needed</EM></EM>. 
Items not already in the library's collection must be 
either purchased or interloaned from other LIU campuses and, 
therefore, may take longer than one month to reach the Reserve Desk. 
Although the Reserve Desk accepts personal books and other 
materials, the library cannot be held responsible for their loss or 
damage. 

<P>The reserve status of an item automatically terminates at the end of a semester, 
unless otherwise indicated. Please remember that the library must comply with 
copyright law (<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Copyright, Fair Use and ERes</FONT></U>).
