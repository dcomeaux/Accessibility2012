<P><CENTER><EM>A Student Guide to Electronic Reserve</EM></CENTER>


<P>Your professor has placed readings for your class on Electronic Reserve, or ERes. ERes is a 
system that allows you to access reserve reading from any computer with internet access, whether 
you are in the library, in a computer lab, at home, or at work. You can choose to read materials 
online, download them to your home computer, or print them out for later reference. 


<P><EM>Finding Your Course</EM><BR>
Begin by visiting the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>C.W. Post ERes home page</FONT></U> on the library's 
website. From this page you can search for your instructor, department, or a keyword from your 
course title. Your search will give you a list of courses that match the criteria you searched for. 
You may select your course from that list. 


<P><EM>Logging On</EM><BR> 
In order to access your course materials, you may need to enter a password for your course. If you 
need one for your particular course page, you can also get the password from your professor or 
from the Circulation desk in the library. If you have trouble with this password, you may contact 
the Circulation desk. After entering your password, you will have to accept the copyright 
statement given in order to enter your course page. If you do not understand the statement, or 
would like more information on copyright, please contact the Circulation desk. 


<P><EM>Finding Your Reading</EM><BR> 
Once you have entered your course page, you will need to locate the reading you need. There are 
several methods your professor may use to sort materials. Documents may be sorted either 
alphabetically or in the order in which they were posted. Your professor may also choose to have 
items sorted into folders. For example, he or she could have a folder labeled &quot;Tests&quot; 
and another labeled &quot;Readings.&quot; Items would then be sorted either alphabetically or 
in time order within those folders. 


<P><EM>Viewing, Saving, And Printing</EM><BR> 
There are several types of documents that can be posted on ERes. The most common types will 
be .pdf files (which can be viewed in Adobe Acrobat Reader), Microsoft Word files (.doc), and 
Microsoft Excel (.xls) files. Students will need to have access to the corresponding 
&quot;viewer&quot;. These viewers are available in all the computer labs 
 on campus. 
 However, students who own computers on or off campus may need 
 to install the appropriate viewer or plugin for your course/reserve materials. 
If you do not have the appropriate program on your computer, 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>free 
viewers and plugins are available for download through ERes</FONT></U>. <BR>


<P><EM>Technical Requirements</EM><BR>
ERes now uses &quot;session variables&quot; 
 to remember information associated with your activity during an ERes session. 
 This information is temporary and disappears either when you log out of 
 ERes, or after a specified time-out period has elapsed. In addition, the 
 ERes server writes an ID number on your local machine, in order to differentiate 
 you from others using the system at the same time. For this reason, you 
 must set your browser to accept cookies. ERes does not write permanent 
 cookies to your machine! However, in order to write your session ID number, 
 cookies must be enabled. Most 
browsers accept cookies by default so you probably will not have to do anything for your 
browser to work with ERes.

<P><BR><EM>Getting Help</EM><BR> 
If you are having trouble using ERes, you can obtain online help by clicking the

516-299-2303, during library hours.
