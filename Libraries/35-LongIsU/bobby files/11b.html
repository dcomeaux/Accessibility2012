<EM>Introduction to the Library</EM>
</FONT></U><BR>




The <EM>B. Davis Schwartz Memorial 
Library</EM> has a large and diverse collection 
with over 2 million volumes, access to more than 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>49,000 periodicals</FONT></U>, 
and over <U><FONT COLOR=blue>280 online databases</FONT></U>, most 
of which include scholarly, peer-reviewed, and professional journals, 
as well as over 700 online encyclopedias. 
Remote access is available for more and more of these databases to LIU users. 

<P>The library is equipped with more than 70 computers for student use and 
wireless internet access, along with a quiet study area for students, a copy 
center, and the Bookmark Caf&eacute;. Additional computers can be found 
in the Information Technology labs that are also in the library. 

<P>The collections of all Long Island 
University libraries (including the 
Brooklyn, Brentwood and Rockland 
Campuses) are listed in <U><FONT COLOR=blue>LIUCat</FONT></U>. This 
computerized network makes information 
available to faculty and students at all 
LIU campuses. Books, journal articles, 
and other library materials that are not available at this campus can be 
requested through <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan</FONT></U>; 
materials within the LIU library system are forwarded 
by the University courier systems, 
by fax, or by mail. 

<P>The library is open <U><FONT COLOR=blue>86 hours a week</FONT></U>, 
including evenings and weekends, with 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>special extended hours</FONT></U> during final 
examinations periods. The library is also the home of the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>School of Education</FONT></U>, the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>College of 
Information and Computer Science</FONT></U>, the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Palmer School of Library and Information 
Science</FONT></U>, the Audio-Visual Department, 
the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Office of Information Technology</FONT></U>, 
the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Post Library Association</FONT></U>, and the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Hutchins Gallery</FONT></U>. 

<P>An extensive <U><FONT COLOR=blue>instruction program</FONT></U> is 
available to graduate students through 
class lectures, demonstrations, orientations, and 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>research by appointment</FONT></U>. 
Various classes demonstrating 
the intricacies of conducting research 
using all types of sources and formats, 
including online resources, are offered to 
the entire Campus community. 
Library competency education is provided to 
undergraduates through a seven-session 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>library workshop</FONT></U>. The Library collaborates 
with the English Department to 
teach <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Information Literacy</FONT></U>. 

<P>The Reference Services Department is part of 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Reference Commons</FONT></U>, which combines 
the collections of the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Reference 
Department</FONT></U>, the Center for Business and 
Information Research, and the Library 
and Information Science Library. 

<P>The Reference collection, with 36,000 
volumes of reference and research materials, 
is particularly strong in the areas of 
literature and the art. LIU users 
can avail themselves 
of the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>online chat service</FONT></U> or request 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>research help via email</FONT></U>. 

<P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Center 
for Business Research</FONT></U> 
was developed through the integration of 
the former Nassau County Research 
Library with C.W. Post's existing 
resources. Its broad range of materials 
include company directories, international 
resources, industry data, and financial 
services

<P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library and Information Science Library</FONT></U>'s 
resources are primarily used by doctoral, 
master's and undergraduate degree students 
in the Palmer School of Library 
and Information Science. There are 
more than 22,000 volumes in this specialized 
collection located in the bookstacks, along with online 
and hardcopy journal subscriptions.

<P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Periodicals Department</FONT></U> houses a current and retrospective 
collection of over 7,000 journals, magazines, newspapers, and other 
publications - over half of which are not available elsewhere through our online 
subscriptions to over 49,000 titles. 
Print and online 
indexes and databases provide 
access to the material. While a wide 
range of academic subjects is included in 
its holdings, the Department is particularly 
strong in psychology, education, literature, 
art, and business. 

<P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Instructional Media Center</FONT></U> is the 
multimedia resource center of the C. W. 
Post Campus, with over 1,500 films, 
videos, interactive CD-ROMs, and a rich 
variety of other audiovisual resources. 
The IMC contains media equipment, 
production, and preview facilities. Its 
exemplary collection of curriculum 
resources for K-12 (teacher resource 
materials, children's books, and textbooks) 
supports the Education and the 
Library and Information Science programs. 

<P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Digital Initiatives and Art Slide Library</FONT></U> is a collection of 
more than 100,000 slides encompassing a 
vast array of images dating from prehistoric 
times through the 21st century and 
represents all forms of art media. 

<P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Special Collections Department</FONT></U> 
contains many notable holdings, such as: 
the only portion of <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Carlotta and Eugene 
O'Neill's personal library</FONT></U> that survives as 
a whole; the William Randolph Hearst 
art photograph collection; a comprehensive 
collection, donated by the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Theodore 
Roosevelt Association</FONT></U>, of TR's life, times 
and writings; <U><FONT COLOR=blue>5,000 movie posters</FONT></U> mainly 
from the 1940s and 1950s; letters by 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Henry James</FONT></U> to his publisher; the Fine 
Art Facsimile Editions of the <EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Book of 
Kells</FONT></U></EM> and the <EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Tres Riches Heures of Jean, 
Duc du Berry</FONT></U></EM>; and the developing 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Winthrop Palmer collection of rare 
books of Irish and French literature</FONT></U>. 
The Department also has the archives of 
Long Island University, especially the C.W. 
Post Campus, featuring a complete run of 
the student newspaper, <EM>The Pioneer</EM>, and 
the student yearbook, <EM>Opticon</EM>, as well as 
other University documents. 

</FONT></U> 
<P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>American 
Juvenile Collection</FONT></U> (AJC) 
contains children's books of 
fiction and folklore printed by American Publishers between 
1910 and 1960. It continues the gathering of children's books by 
Christine B. Gilbert, formerly a professor at the Palmer School, that 
included fiction and non-fiction, mostly from Great Britain, published 
before 1909. The AJC retains a few of them, especially appropriate 
fiction titles. It is anticipated that the 
AJC, when complete, will 
hold 25,000 titles, the most comprehensive depository on the 
continent. Ultimately, the majority of the collection will be 
first editions. Presently the AJC contains over 2,000 first 
editions among its 5,250 volumes. Some of the books are 
especially noteworthy: <EM>The Blind Pig's Book</EM>, an 
artist's journal of his publishing colleagues by Kurt Wiese; 
a dummy copy of <EM>The Little Stone House</EM>, together with 
the first edition by Berta and Elmer Hader, as well 
as a good run of their many books; and an extensive collection of 
the drawings and illustrated book by Paul Brown, a noted 
Long Island illustrator. 
The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>catalog 
is available over the internet</FONT></U>, or, for personal inquires, email 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>diana.spirt@liu.edu</FONT></U>. 


<P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Post 
Library Association</FONT></U>, a Friends of the 
Library organization, was founded by Mrs. 
Winthrop B. Palmer, a former member of the 
Board of Trustees of Long Island 
University and a professor of English at 
C.W. Post. The PLA conducts many <U><FONT COLOR=blue>cultural 
and educational programs</FONT></U> in the 
Hutchins Gallery. Alumni and other 
friends of the University are cordially 
invited to join the membership. 

<P>Through 
the generosity of the Carleton H. and 
Winthrop B. Palmer Memorial Fund, an 
endowment of over four million dollars 
enables the library to purchase materials 
in the arts and humanities, supplementing 
its regular budget for acquisitions and enriching collections immeasurably.
