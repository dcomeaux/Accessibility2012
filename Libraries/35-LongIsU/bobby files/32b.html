<P>The Library and the Reference Department offer its patrons a
 wide variety of services. 
 Some of these include:
 
<DL>
 
<DT><P><EM>Research Assistance</EM>
<BR><DD>Information specialists are available 86 hours a week in the
 Reference Department to provide research assistance to students,
 faculty and staff. This
 highly trained faculty regularly answers a wide variety of questions
 from the most basic to the more advanced. Students often seek help
 in choosing and using the proper database or finding the right book.
 But the large percentage of queries are more advanced and require
 extensive knowledge of all the Library’s databases and
 collections. These questions can involve limiting searches to
 scholarly research or peer-reviewed publications or locating that
 most esoteric bibliographic reference from the 1700’s. Faculty are
 frequent users of the valuable assistance provided them in their
 research efforts. 
 
 
<DT><P><EM>Telephone Assistance</EM>
<BR><DD>is available and is particularly
 effective with remote access navigation. Please feel free 
 to contact us at (516) 299-2305 or (516) 299-2306. 
 
 
<DT><P><EM>Electronic Reference Service</EM>
<BR><DD>You can <U><FONT COLOR=blue>chat online</FONT></U> with a librarian. 
For the more intricate questions, try our <U><FONT COLOR=blue>email
 reference service</FONT></U>. A librarian checks the department
 email daily and tries to responds in a timely fashion. Long Island
 University patrons are given priority. 
 
 
<DT><P><EM>Research by Appointment</EM> 
<BR><DD>In addition to online reference assistance, email assistance, 
telephone assistance, and, of course, visiting the library 
whenever you need to, you can now also make an appointment 
with a librarian to get intensive one-on-one 
research assistance and undivided attention. The library has 
many online and hardcopy resources that many 
people are unaware of, and the databases have many advanced 
features for pulling up the desired results. People 
often think that they've tried all the possibilities and become 
convinced that the information that they need does 
not exist when there are still many more options. Make an appointment for a private 
consultation with a librarian by calling 516-299-4138 or 
516-299-4139.  
 
 
<DT><P><EM>Database Instruction for Faculty</EM> 
<BR><DD>For faculty members who want to find out more about 
the library's databases but can't come to us: we'll come to 
you! The library is offering a new program for faculty in 
which you can make an appointment for a librarian to come 
to your office at your convenience to demonstrate the latest 
databases. If you prefer, you can make an appointment for 
instruction in the library. Just email or call Jean Uhl, chair of the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library Liaison Committee</FONT></U>  
(<U><FONT COLOR=blue>juhl@liu.edu</FONT></U>, x2837), or 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Larry Kirschenbaum</FONT></U> 
(<U><FONT COLOR=blue>ljkirsch@liu.edu</FONT></U>, x2704) 
to make the appointment or for further details.  


<DT><P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library Instruction</FONT></U></EM>
<BR><DD>The Reference Department has a wide variety of instructional programs 
for classes and individuals covering the use of databases and other 
resources. Specialized instruction is also available from 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>other library departments</FONT></U>. 


<DT><P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan</FONT></U></EM> 
<BR><DD>Interlibrary loan serves to expand the range of publications available to the C.W. Post
community. Faculty and students may request that publications not owned by C.W. Post be
borrowed from other libraries on a local and national level.


<DT><P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Brown Bag Series</FONT></U></EM> 
<BR><DD>These brief and informal, &quot;come as you are&quot; gatherings will cover a variety 
of topics, including tips on providing reference service in our new environment, discussion 
about the latest in technological trends, and strategies for handling a variety of reference 
encounters.  


<DT><P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library Liaison Program</FONT></U></EM> 
<BR><DD>All the Reference librarians participate in the Library
 Liaison program. This is another collaborative effort on the
 part of the Library to reach out to the faculty and partner with
 them to improve the collections and services of the Library. Each
 department is assigned a library liaison who filters information
 about new Library databases, services, programs, etc. through each
 academic department’s liaison. In turn, the department liaison
 alerts us to new courses, programs, etc. so that we can better meet
 and adapt to changing departmental and curricular needs and
 anticipate future needs. 
 
 
<DT><P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Preparation of Bibliographies</FONT></U></EM> 
<BR><DD>The librarians compile pertinent bibliographies, user guides,
 pathfinders and handbooks as needed to complement library
 instruction programs and serve as general information sources. Visit
 Department Publications on our website for a sampling of new and
 archived publications. 
 
 
<DT><P><EM>Collection Development</EM>
<BR><DD>The librarians try to anticipate future curricular needs and
 trends by ordering relevant items for the collection in print and
 electronic form. Your suggestions are welcomed. 
Please visit the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Acquisitions
 Department</FONT></U> website to make a recommendation.
