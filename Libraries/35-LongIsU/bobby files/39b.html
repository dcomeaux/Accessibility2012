<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>The American Juvenile Collection</FONT></U> (AJC)</EM> 

<BR>Initiated in 1976 by Professor Diana L. Spirt, Ph.D., (Emerita) of the Palmer School of 
Library and Information Science, to provide a research collection of children's fiction, 
folklore, and fairy tales printed in North America, covering the years 1910-1960. There is 
an extensive Reference Collection, as well as some children's books in foreign languages.  
<P>The AJC retains a few children's books, published before 1910, that were gathered by 
Christine Gilbert, a former professor of the Palmer School. 

<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Highlighting Selected Authors/Illustrators</FONT></U></EM> 
from the American Juvenile Collection. 

<P><EM>The AJC Archival Collections</EM> 
<BR>These archival collections contain research materials of authors' and illustrators' correspondence, 
illustrations, photographs, childrens book editors' correspondences, galley proofs, dummy copies, 
and miscellaneous ephemera. These archival collections demonstrate the importance of donating.  
The materials are now assured to help increase the body of knowledge in the field by adding a 
permanent record that is available electronically to the student, researcher and interested person.  
<P>We encourage anyone to donate a single, multiple or estate collection of books and materials, 
such as manuscripts, letters, illustrations, photos of authors or illustrators covering the AJC's time 
period of 1910-1960 that deserve a permanent home.  We hope you contact us in the American Juvenile 
Collection and look forward to hearing from you.

<P><LI><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>The Joan Hoerger Fern Place Elementary School Library &quot;Letters 
to Authors Project&quot;</FONT></U></EM> 
<BR>An AJC archival letter collection was donated by Mrs. Joan Hoerger, the librarian at the Fern Place 
Elementary School, Plainview, New York.  It represents a library class project designed to 
encourage reading.  Each student wrote a letter to her/his favorite author. 35 
authors/illustrators from Joy Adamson to Carol Beach York responded warmly to the pupils. 
These letters are illustrated in many instances and include brochures and photos from 
authors/illustrators who were popular with elementary school age children. 

<P>Each of the following archival letters is described briefly and listed under the authors/illustrators 
name in the following Finding Aid.  We suggest that you also browse the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>AJC Collection's database</FONT></U>. 


<P><LI><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>The Saidie Scudder Archival Collection</FONT></U></EM> 
<BR>The Saidie Scudder Archival Collection was donated in 1988 by Saidie E. Scudder, 
1907 - 2001 and her older sister Hazel L., who died in 
1990.  Their parents, P. Halstead and Sarah Townsend Scudder, were descendents of an 
historical Quaker family line on Long Island, New York.  The sisters were also active Quakers 
who in their later years were responsible for providing funding for the restoration of the old 
Quaker meeting house in Matinecock that had been destroyed by fire.  They lived in Glen Cove, 
New York and were active gardeners, sharing classes in their greenhouse, as well as engaging 
in community projects.  In their final years, they lived in Mill Neck, New York.
<P>The collection is from their inheritance in 1984 from the estate of a long-time friend Dorothy 
Marie Bryan, who was the children's book editor at Dodd, Mead &amp; Company.  The collection 
contains pre-publication illustrations and a variety of materials created by well known children's 
author-illustrators in the American Juvenile Collection's time period.

<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Cedar Swamp Historical Society Collection</FONT></U></EM>

<BR>This invaluable library of books, periodicals, pamphlets, maps, historical documents, 
letters, flags, and other materials, was generously donated to Long Island University by 
the Cedar Swamp Historical Society under the auspices and direction of its former President, 
John G. Peterkin. Of the more than 1,100 books, the subjects range from town histories and 
biographies of Long Island personages (as Theodore Roosevelt) to monographs on Long 
Island archeology and the Long Island Railroad, from many books on Long Island shipping 
and family histories to writings by Long Island poets and novelists, such as Walt Whitman 
and Christopher Morley.

<P>We have extensive periodical holdings such as <EM>The Long Island Forum</EM> and 
<EM>The Journal of Long Island History</EM>. The collection boasts such treasures as 18th 
century Long Island family letters and deeds, poems in manuscript by John Howard Payne, 
and several Revolutionary War documents. The latter were displayed in 2000 at the 
Nassau County Art Museum, along with several flags. 

<P><EM>Cedar Swamp Historical Society Collection:  Long Island Places</EM><BR>
Long Island, stretching some 120 miles from New York City into the Atlantic Ocean, is 
divided into four areas:  Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk.  Within these groupings are a 
myriad of towns and villages, communities large and small, past and present. They are replete 
with histories, legends and traditions, hidden lore, persistent mysteries and local characteristics 
that continue to stimulate researchers.  The following annotated list of articles in periodicals 
demonstrates the variety and depth of information available.  Soon, a listing of books and pamphlets 
with the same local focus will be posted on this site.

<P><EM>French and Irish Literature: The Winthrop Palmer Collection</EM>

<BR>Following the original strictures of <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Mrs. Winthrop Palmer's</FONT></U> 
generous bequest to the Library, much rare Irish and French 
literature has been acquired.  Although we have concentrated 
on the Nobel prize-winning avant-garde writer, Samuel Beckett, 
an Irishman who wrote both in French and English, we have 
collected rare items of many French and Irish writers, mainly 
from the 19th and 20th centuries, in a variety of literary forms.  
This collection has grown, in just a few years, to several 
thousand titles.  It includes a manuscript of eighteen year-old 
Simone de Beauvoir, the first edition of Joyce's <EM>Ulysses</EM>, and 
significant rarities by Yeats, Colette, Wilde, George Moore, 
Shaw, French surrealist and symbolist poets, Seamus Heaney, 
and much more.

Art and a pre-eminent example of an illuminated manuscript.  

<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Les tr&egrave;s riches heures du Duc de Berry</FONT></U></EM>
<BR>A prayer book of
exceptional quality, full of great beauty.  It is a rich
compendium of brilliant small paintings and it ranks

<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Les heures de Turin-Milan</FONT></U></EM> 
<BR>An illuminated prayer-book.
Initially commissioned by the Duc de Berry in 1380.
This work was importantly advanced by Jan van Eyck, producing his only known miniatures. 
It was completed by van Eyck's group of illuminators after his death. The original manuscript, 
which is a missal despite its title, now resides in the 
Museo Civico d'Arte Antica in Turin. 

<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>The Ellesmere Chaucer</FONT></U></EM> 
<BR>From the Huntington Library
of Marino, California, this manuscript of Geoffrey Chaucer's
<EM>Canterbury Tales</EM>, made soon after 1400, is the most
famous of all English literary, illuminated manuscripts,
featuring twenty-three portraits of the storytellers, including 
Chaucer himself.  (The acquisition of this facsimile is
especially dedicated to the memory of the late C.W. Post
Professor of English, Dr. Richard Griffith).

<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Original Movie Poster Research Collection, 
	1940-1962</FONT></U></EM> 
<BR>This collection is a vivid and instructive series of images, lithograph movie posters 
that promote more than 6,000 movie titles produced mostly from 1940 to 1962. Some 4,000 posters, 
covering the years 1950-1962 were donated by Frederick Adler in 1972. Mr. Adler added approximately 
1,000 more titles, concentrating on the early 1950's, in 1974. Philip Sills donated about 1,600 posters 
in 1974 that reflected the decade of the1940's. 

<P>Besides the obvious appeal to film students, these original movie posters should interest other 
academic disciplines. Art majors will be stimulated by the varying graphic design approaches of these 
examples of movie poster art. Business students will appreciate the marketing effectiveness, or lack 
thereof, of the differing ways to advertise movies. Many movies of this time period reflect the history 
of World War II and the Cold War. These film images are of value not only to students of history, 
but also to the social researcher for their shifts in mores and culture. 

<P><EM>Original Movie Poster Research Collection by Genre</EM>  
<BR>The subjects of movies as with books are categorized into general areas of similar 
interest or genres.  The genres used herein are from a standard reference guide.  
As with most of our collections, we encourage donations of original movie posters 
providing they are within our time frame and conform to our size constraints.
