  <P>Locating sources appropriate for academic research 
requires time and a critical eye. It is also 
important to evaluate those sources, identifying 
the best ones for your research. Learning to apply 
criteria by which you can evaluate both print and 
electronic information should make it easier for 
you to choose good sources.

<P>The type of research you are doing will 
determine how closely you examine your sources. You 
would probably be less critical of information 
gathered for your own personal interest than for a 
paper. Academic research requires accurate and 
documented sources.

<P>This section will focus on locating, evaluating, 
and citing print and electronic sources. 

<P>After completing this section, you should be 
able to:

<UL>
<LI>locate books in the library using call 
numbers
<LI>use the library's online catalog
<LI>recognize the different parts of a URL

<P><EM>Using the Online Catalog LIUCAT -- Locate It in 
Print </EM></FONT></U>


<P>The library's catalog, LIUCAT, can be accessed 
on the Web from the library homepage or at the 
following address:  <U><FONT COLOR=blue>http://liucat.liu.edu</FONT></U> 

<P>
<CENTER><TABLE><TR>
<TD>[Help Button]</TD>
<TD>This 
is a brief introduction to using LIUCAT.  
For more in-depth help refer to the online user's 
guide which accompanies LIUCAT.  You can access it 
by clicking on the Help button  at any time during your search.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>



<P> 


<P><BR><EM>Types of Searches</EM>


<P>LIUCAT has three different search types that you 
can use to find the material you want: 
<UL>
<P><LI><EM>Basic.</EM> This allows you to combine terms. 
<P><LI><EM>Advanced.</EM> This allows you to specify and 
combine words in different fields and limit by 
campus, collection, or item type. 
<P><LI><EM>List A-Z.</EM> This displays an alphabetical list of 
authors, titles, subjects, series, or call 
numbers. You can scroll to any point in the 
list and choose the topic you want. 
</UL>
These buttons are available at the top of your 
browser so that you can quickly and easily switch 
from one type of search to another:


<P><CENTER>[IPAC Toolbar]</CENTER>


<P><BR><EM>Basic Search</EM> 	


<P>To do a Basic Search:

<OL>
<P><LI>Click the <EM>Basic</EM> button. 
<P><LI>Choose the type of search you want to do from 
the pull-down menu. 
<P><LI>Enter your search words and click  
[the Go Button]
</OL>

<P>Basic search allows you to do the following keyword 
searches:  
<UL>
<LI>general keyword
<LI>title keyword
<LI>author keyword
<LI>subject keyword
<LI>series keyword
</UL>

<P>A <EM>general keyword</EM> search looks for the words you 
enter in the <EM>entire record</EM>.  It is often a good 
starting point for your search.  The other types of 
keyword searches look for the words you enter only 
in the <EM>fields specified</EM> by the type of search you 
choose, such as title, author or subject.  

<P>For 
example, a <EM>title keyword</EM> search looks for the words 
you enter in the title fields only, so if you were 
to do a title keyword search for the words &quot;<EM>internet</EM>&quot;  
and &quot;<EM>directory</EM>&quot; your results would include the 
titles:  <EM>Internet Tollfree National 
Directory</EM> and 
<EM>Directory of 
Internet Sources for Health 
Professionals</EM>.

<P><EM>After</EM> the results are displayed, Basic search also allows you to 
sort results by date, author, or title, and to limit the serach by campus, collection, 
or media type.




<P><BR><EM>Advanced Search</EM>


<P>To do an Advanced search
<OL>
<P><LI>Click the <EM>Advanced</EM> button. 
<P><LI>Use the field modifier (type of keyword search) 
listed on the left of the search text box and 
the Boolean operators listed on the right to 
narrow your searching scope.  
<P><LI>Click 
[the Go Button]
</OL>


<P>The advantage of an Advanced search over a Basic 
search is the ability to combine different kinds of 
keyword searches using the Boolean operators <EM><EM>and</EM></EM>, 
<EM><EM>or</EM></EM>, and <EM><EM>not</EM></EM>.  This allows you to be much more 
specific in your search strategy.

<UL>
<LI><EM>AND</EM>: Narrows your search to items that 
contain both words you enter.
<LI><EM>OR</EM>: Broadens your search to items that contain 
either word you enter.
<LI><EM>NOT</EM>: Narrows your search to items that contain 
one word you enter, but not the other.
</UL>

<P>(For more information on using Boolean 
operators, refer to <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Combining Ideas -- 
Boolean Logic</FONT></U> in Section 2.)

<P>Advanced search allows you combine up to four of 
the following keyword searches in any combination:  
<UL>
<LI>general keyword
<LI>title keyword
<LI>author keyword
<LI>subject keyword
<LI>series keyword
</UL>

<P>Example:  If you are looking for dictionaries 
about chemistry, you could use the following 
advanced search to narrow your search and retrieve 
the most relevant records:  Do a <EM>subject</EM> keyword 
search for &quot;<EM>dictionaries</EM>&quot; and use the 
<EM><EM>and</EM></EM> operator to 
combine that search with a <EM>general</EM> keyword search 
for &quot;<EM>chemistry</EM>&quot;.

<P><EM>Limiting</EM><BR>
You also have the option to limit your search.  You can limit by Campus 
(C.W. Post, Brooklyn, Southampton, Brentwood, 
Rockland), Collection (Circulation, Reference, 
Periodicals, Business, IMC, etc.), or by Media Type 
(books, videos, cds).
  
<P><EM>Sorting</EM><BR>
You can choose to have your results sorted by date, author, title, or media type 
(i.e., videorecording, microform, book, etc.). 
If you don't, the results are automatically sorted in reverse 
chronological order which means the most recently 
published items will appear first.  After your 
initial search you will also have the option to 
re-sort your results.



<P><BR><EM>List A-Z Search</EM>

<P>
Use the List A-Z Search option to retrieve various 
alphabetical listings to browse, such as authors, 
titles, subjects, and series.  This is a good 
choice if you know the specific author, title, or 
subject that you wish to find. For example, you can 
enter &quot;hemingway&quot; to get an alphabetical 
list of authors whose last names begin with 
&quot;hemingway.&quot;

<P>To use the List A-Z Search option
<OL>
<P><LI>Click the <EM>Lists A-Z</EM> button.
<P><LI>Choose the Available List that you want to 
browse (Title List, Author List, Subject List, 
Periodical Title List, Library of Congress Call 
Number List, Series List, ISBN). 
<P><LI>Enter a word or phrase to browse in the text 
box. 
<P><LI>Click   
[the Go Button] 
<P>LIUCAT displays the List A-Z Summary. 
<P><LI>Choose the phrase you want. 
<P>LIUCAT displays the Item Information screen 
containing the term you chose from the List.
</OL>


<P><BR><EM>Results Screens</EM>

<P>If there are matches for more than one item, LIUCAT 
opens the <EM>Search Results</EM> screen.  This is a listing 
of short entries for all the items retrieved by 
your search. You can go into the item information for an 
individual item by clicking on the hyperlink of its 
title.

<P><EM>Item Information</EM> 
<BR>If your search finds only one 
item LIUCAT will take you directly into the item 
information screen.

<P>The item information screen gives the following 
information about an item:
<UL>
<LI>Complete bibliographic details including 
title, author, publication year, and Library of 
Congress subject headings
<LI>Which campuses of LIU own the item
<LI>Which collection to find the item in 
(circulation, reference, business, etc.)
<LI>Call number
<LI>Whether the book is checked in or checked out
<LI>The due date if the book is checked out
<LI>Whether the book is on reserve
</UL>

<P>When you find items that you wish to locate in 
the library be sure to write the title, author and 
call number down.  You will need the call number to 
find the item on the shelf. Or you can use the <EM>My List</EM> feature. 




<P><BR><EM>My List and Emailing</EM>

<P>[Add to my list Button]
You can add items to  <EM>My List</EM> as you search by 
clicking on the   &quot;<EM>Add to my list</EM>&quot; 
button which appears to the 
right of the item.  

<P>[My List Button]
When you've put all the items 
you want on your list, click the &quot;<EM>My List</EM>&quot; button and print the results or use 
the email option to send the items to a specific 
email address.  You can also email an entire search 
to a specific address by scrolling to the bottom of 
the search screen and filling in the appropriate 
information before clicking &quot;Email items&quot;.  
Be sure to 
enter a full destination e-mail address (for 
example, jdoe@wherever.com).

<P><EM>Finding the Books -- Understanding Call 
Numbers</EM></FONT></U>

    
<P>Have you ever wondered how library books are 
assigned their places on the shelves? Did you know 
that the call number -- the number placed on the 
spine of the book -- is a code which provides 
valuable information about the book? 
 

<P><BR><EM>What are call numbers for?</EM>


<P>Each book in the library has a unique call number. 
A call number is like an address: it tells us where 
the book is located in the library. 

<P>Call numbers appear on the spines of books and in the online catalog:
	

<P><CENTER>[Call numbers appear on the spines of books and in the online catalog]
</CENTER>



<P>Note that the same call number can be written from 
top-to-bottom, or left-to-right.

<P>The <EM>C.W. Post Library</EM>, like many academic 
libraries in the U.S., uses <EM>Library of Congress 
Classification</EM> for call numbers. This system uses a 
combination of letters and numbers to arrange 
materials by subjects.

<P><BR><EM>What does the call number mean?</EM>

<P>Remember that Library of Congress Classification 
arranges materials by subjects. The first sections 
of the call number represent the subject of the 
book. The letter-and-decimal section of the call 
number often represents the author's last name. 
And, as you recall, the last section of a call 
number is often the date of publication.  
<EM>Example:</EM>  


<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><P><EM>Title:</EM>  
What You Need to Know About Developing Study Skills, 
Taking Notes &amp; Tests, Using Dictionaries &amp; Libraries
<P><EM>Author:</EM>  Coman, Marcia J.
<P><EM>Call number:</EM>  LB2395 .C65 1991
</TD>
<TD><P>The first two 
lines describe the subject of the book.

</TD>
<TD>LB<BR>
2395<BR>
.C65<BR>
1991<BR>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><P>The third line often 
represents the authors last name: 
.C65=Coman
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><P>The last line is the year the 
book was published.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>



<P><BR><EM>Why is this important to know?</EM>

<P>Because books are classified by subject, you can 
often find several helpful books on the same shelf, 
or nearby. For example, within the same call number 
LB2395, there are other guides for college study.

<P>In large libraries many items on the same 
subject will have similar call numbers. It is 
important to write down the <EM>entire</EM> call number in 
order to locate the item on the shelf.

<P>Remember that the Library of Congress arranges 
materials by subject. The first section of the call 
number represents the subject of the book. The 
second section represents the author's name and the 
last section is often the date of publication. 

<P>The first line of a call number may begin with one, 
two or three letters. These letters should be read 
alphabetically. A call number that begins with A is 
shelved before one that begins with B, C, etc.; and 
a call number that begins with QE is shelved 
somewhere between the one that starts with Q and 
the one that starts with QL. 

<P>Single letters are filed before double letters.

<P>The second line of a call number is made of a 
number that may have one or more digits. This line 
is read numerically. A call number with a smaller 
number in its second line is shelved before one 
that has a larger number for its second line.

<P>The third line is the trickiest part of the call 
number. The letter is shelved alphabetically, and 
the number following the letter is treated as if it 
were preceded by a decimal.

</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>


<P>When the top three lines are identical, look to 
the fourth line. If it contains a letter followed 
by numbers, items are organized alphabetically by 
letter, and within each letter by decimal number. 
Note the number is treated as a decimal number even 
though there is no visible decimal point.

<P><BR><EM>Finding Articles by Using the Catalog</EM>

<P>Periodical titles can also be found 
using the online catalog. Let's say you had this 
citation for an article: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>France, Mike. &quot;Free speech on the Net? Not 
quite.&quot; <EM>Business Week</EM>. Feb 28 2000: 93-94.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

By searching the library catalog for the periodical 
title <EM>Business Week</EM>, you could see if your library 
owns that magazine and what the holdings are for 
that title. Once you have the location, you can 
find the periodical in the appropriate department.  
If you don't find the article or periodical you are 
looking for, be sure to check with a librarian for 
other options.

<P><EM>Locate It on the Web</EM></FONT></U>

    
<P>Just as every item in the library has its own 
call number, every image, file, page, or program on 
the Web has its own individual location. To find 
these online sources, you need the Web address 
called a Uniform Resource Locator or URL. The URL 
identifies the computer, directory, and file where 
an item is located and the type of protocol needed 
to read that item. Capitalization, punctuation, and 
spacing must be exact for a URL to work.  



  
<P><BR><EM>Anatomy of a URL</EM></FONT></U>
  

<P>You might use the URL to identify information 
about the source of a Web page.

<P>Let's look at some URLs to find out more about 
the structure and organization of addresses on the 
Web.

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE>

<TR>
<TD>http://www.dollarsR_US.com/</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>http://</EM></TD>
<TD>The first part of the 
address indicates what 
type of protocol you need 
to view this item.
In this case, 
&quot;http&quot; means 
hypertext transfer 
protocol which is the 
standard protocol of a 
web page.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>www</EM></TD>
<TD>The &quot;www&quot; 
stands for World Wide 
Web.
Many URLs start with 
these letters.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>dollarsR_US</EM></TD>
<TD>This part of the address 
usually contains the 
name, or abbreviated 
name, of the organization 
sponsoring the 
information.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>com</EM></TD>
<TD>This is the domain name 
and indicates what <EM>type</EM> 
of organization is 
sponsoring the site.  In 
this case it is a 
company.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>http://sis.liunet.edu/~bob/Paper/Bio.html</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>http://</EM></TD>
<TD>This indicates that this page uses the 
Web protocol.  
Some other protocols are telnet or 
news.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>sis</EM></TD>
<TD>This page is on a server, or 
&quot;host&quot; computer, called 
&quot;sis&quot;.  URLs do not have to 
start with www.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>liunet</EM></TD>
<TD>This name indicates that this page is 
coming from Long Island University.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>edu</EM></TD>
<TD>This domain name means that the 
sponsoring institution is an 
educational institution.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>~bob</EM></TD>
<TD>The &quot;~&quot; indicates that this 
is a personal account, probably for 
someone named Bob.  It is always wise 
to be more critical when evaluating 
information from a personal site since 
it is more difficult to determine the 
reliability of the information.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>Paper</EM></TD>
<TD>This is the name of the directory in 
the &quot;bob&quot; account.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>Bio</EM></TD>
<TD>This is the file name.  Capitalization 
and punctuation are important in URLs.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><EM>html</EM></TD>
<TD>This is the file extension and 
indicates the file's format.  In this 
instance the file is HTML or hypertext 
markup language -- the predominant format 
found on the Web.</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>


<P><BR>Let's take a closer look at some of the parts of 
the URL:



<P><BR><EM>Protocols</EM></FONT></U>

<P>In the online world, protocols make it possible for 
different types of computers -- Macintosh, PC, UNIX 
 -- to communicate with each other. They are 
standards or rules that enable one computer to 
understand messages sent from another and then act 
on those messages.  They always come before the 
URL.  There are many protocols for communicating on 
the Internet.  Some common ones are: 

<UL>

<P><LI>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) : transmit 
information on the Web 
<P><LI>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) : send and 
receive electronic mail 
<P><LI>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) : transfer files 
between computers 
<P><LI>Telnet protocol (telnet) : login from a local 
desktop computer to a remote server and use its 
resources
</UL>
	
<P>Without protocols, computers would have no idea 
what to do with our email messages or how to 
display a Web page.




<P><BR><EM>Groups on the Web</EM>

<P>The information you find on the Web is as varied as 
the people who put it there. 
Groups that publish information on the Web 
include: 

<P><EM>Libraries</EM><BR> 

That's right, libraries are major producers and 
purchasers of quality information on the Web. For 
example, The Library of Congress puts copies of 
important historical photographs and documents 
called &quot;The American Memory Project&quot; on 
its site.

<P><EM>Colleges and Universities</EM><BR> 
 
Universities put entire classes online as well as 
provide space for their <EM>faculty</EM> and <EM>students</EM> to 
produce Web pages. Much of the practical 
information you need to enroll and register for 
classes can be found on the Web.

<P><EM>Government Agencies</EM><BR> 

In order to make information available to more 
people, federal, state, and local governments are 
publishing many documents on the Web. The Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) puts copies of tax forms on 
the Web.

<P><EM>Companies</EM><BR> 

Many companies publish financial documents and 
press releases on their sites. The Web is also a 
major marketing tool for many companies to provide 
information about their products. For example, Nike 
produces a popular site full of sports information.  
Do you think the information in a company web site 
is reliable if they are trying to sell you a 
product?

<P><EM>Organizations</EM><BR> 

Organizations have agendas and opinions that they 
want you to know about. The American Lung 
Association educates about the dangers of smoking 
on its Web page.  Do you think some organizations 
may have a particular bias in the information their 
websites display?

<P><EM>People in foreign countries</EM><BR> 

The Web has global representation. With a computer 
and a phone connection, <EM>anyone</EM> can publish on the 
Web.


<P><BR><EM>Domains</EM>


<P><EM>Top Level Domains</EM> 

<P>Most URLs include the name and type of 
organization sponsoring the page. The type of 
organization is identified by a three-letter code 
called a &quot;top level domain name.&quot; Here are 
some of the most common top level domains you will 
find.  Each indicates something about the nature of 
the site.




<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE>

<TR>
<TD><EM>.edu</EM></TD>
<TD><EM>educational institution</EM><BR>  
Even though a page comes from an 
educational institution, it does not 
mean the institution endorses the views 
expressed there. Students or faculty 
members may publish pages in their 
account on the school's computer.</TD>
</TR>


<TR>
<TD><EM>.com</EM></TD>
<TD><EM>commercial entity</EM><BR>
Many companies advertise and sell 
products, as well as publish annual 
reports and other company information 
for their customers, stockholders, and 
potential investors on the Web. Much of 
the quality information you can 
purchase such as online newspapers or 
journals have .com names.</TD>
</TR>


<TR>
<TD><EM>.gov</EM></TD>
<TD><EM>federal government</EM><BR>
Government agencies use the Web to 
publish legislation, census 
information, weather data, tax forms, 
and many other documents. </TD>
</TR>


<TR>
<TD><EM>.org</EM></TD>
<TD><EM>non-profit organization</EM><BR>
Non-profit organizations use the Web to 
promote their causes. These pages are 
good sources to use when comparing 
different sides of an issue. </TD>
</TR>


<TR>
<TD><EM>.net</EM></TD>
<TD><EM>network provider</EM><BR>
Network providers administer or provide 
connection services to the Internet. 
The .net group is an odd mix of 
companies, associations, and Internet 
service providers. Information on these 
sites can look similar to sites from 
.com, .org, or even personal pages.</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>


<P>Recently the division 
between these top level domains 
became blurred. Sometimes non-profit organizations 
and educational institutions are now found under .com 
or .net. This makes it more difficult to determine 
the organization that is <EM>publishing</EM> the page. 

<P>The number of top level domain names can be 
increased.  Some new top level domain names recently 
approved are:


<P>

</CENTER>






<P><BR><EM>Country Codes</EM>


<P>Sometimes you will see a two-letter country code 
at the end of the URL instead of the three-letter 
organization code. The origin of some 
international sites can be determined by country 
codes found in the URL.  Country codes are also 
top level domain names.  Most URLs in the United 
States do not use the .us country code. Some 
other country codes are:

<P><BR><EM>File Name Extensions</EM>

<P>
Files on the web can be in many different 
formats.  The extension of a file name can tell 
you a lot about the file.  Most documents on the 
Web are written in HTML (hypertext markup 
language).  HTML consists of standard text and 
pictures marked by tags which tell your browser 
how to display them.  So most of the files you 
find on the Web will have the extensions <EM>.html</EM> or 
<EM>.htm</EM>.  However, there are many other types of 
files out there.  The way you can identify the 
type is by looking at its extension.  Some common 
file name extensions are:
