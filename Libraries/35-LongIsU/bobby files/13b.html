<P>The enormous amount of information available electronically today has 
contributed to the startling rise in plagiarism on college campuses.  
Through University-wide training sessions, the Library is committed to 
&quot;Preventing and Detecting Plagiarism&quot; for faculty and students alike. 
Faculty seminars are designed to update fellow faculty members on ways 
to identify plagiarism and to assist in preventing it by providing faculty with 
tips on constructing coursework and assignments to help alleviate this growing 
phenomenon.  Workshops for students are geared to create awareness and 
enlighten students on the issue of plagiarism.



<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>SafeAssign</FONT></U></EM> 
is a new component of LIU's <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Blackboard</FONT></U> 
course management system. It 
compares submitted student papers against a database of websites, 
journal articles, and other student papers to determine which passages, if any, 
have been plagiarized and from which sources. 
Faculty may contact <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Tricia Hinchman</FONT></U> in the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Faculty Technology Resource Center</FONT></U> 
for more information on this plagiarism module.

Post Academic Conduct Site</FONT></U>

<P><EM>Academic Irregularities</EM> <EM>(Student Handbook 2005-2006, p.42)</EM><BR>
&quot;Responsibility for disciplinary action in cases of academic irregularities 
or dishonesty in examinations or class work is assigned to the appropriate 
academic area. Plagiarism and cheating are not only serious violations of the 
rules, but also may reflect adversely on the student's reputation as well as on 
the reputation of the Campus.

<P>&quot;Responsibility for academic integrity is shared by faculty, administrators, and 
students. A student in violation of accepted academic procedures may be 
subject to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion from the Campus. 
Faculty members shall report any case of inappropriate conduct to the department 
chairperson. Students may make such reports to a faculty member, department 
chairperson or dean. 

<P>&quot;Policies and procedures regarding academic irregularities and appeals of 
decisions made in such cases may be obtained from the office of the 
appropriate academic dean.&quot;



<P><EM>Academic Dishonesty</EM> <EM>(Undergraduate Bulletin 2002-2004, p.13)</EM><BR>
&quot;Academic dishonesty is unacceptable,
and condemned in the strongest possible
terms. It undermines the bonds of trust
and honesty between members of the
community and defrauds those who may
eventually depend upon our knowledge
and integrity. Such dishonesty consists of
any of the following:
<P>&quot;Cheating - using or attempting to use
unauthorized materials, information, or
study aids in any academic activity.
<P>&quot;Fabrication - unauthorized falsification
or invention of any information or citation
in an academic activity.
<P>&quot;Plagiarism - representing the words or
ideas of another as one's own in any academic
activity.
<P>&quot;Facilitating academic dishonesty -
helping or attempting to help another to
cheat, fabricate, or plagiarize.
<P>&quot;Academic dishonesty may be punishable
by a range of penalties, including
failure in the course and expulsion from
the University.&quot;


<P><EM>Academic Irregularities</EM> <EM>(Graduate Bulletin 2005-2007, p.16)</EM><BR>
&quot;In cases of academic irregularities or 
dishonesty in examinations or class work, 
responsibility for disciplinary action is 
assigned to the appropriate Academic 
Dean. Plagiarism and cheating are not 
only serious violations of the rules, but 
also may reflect adversely on the student's 
reputation as well as on the reputation 
of the Campus. Faculty, administrators 
and the student body share 
responsibility for academic integrity. A 
student in violation of accepted academic 
procedures may be subject to disciplinary 
action, up to and including 
expulsion from the Campus. Faculty 
members will report to the Academic 
Dean any case of irregular or dishonest 
behavior that occurs in the class or in 
or her observation. Students may likewise 
make such a report to the faculty 
member or dean. The Academic Dean 
will decide what disposition is to be 
made of the charges. Requests for appeals 
may be made to the Student/Faculty 
Appeals Board. 
<P>&quot;In the case of a minor infraction that 
is the student's first disciplinary offense, 
the Dean may authorize the faculty 
member to dispose of the charges, limiting 
the maximum penalty to failure in 
the course. The faculty member will 
make a report of the incident and the 
action taken to the Dean and the 
Judicial Affairs Coordinator. 
<P>&quot;In the case of a major infraction, or in 
the case of repeat academic offenses, the 
student may be subject to suspension or 
expulsion from the Campus. If current 
non-academic disciplinary action is 
pending for a student, further disciplinary 
action may result, up to and including 
expulsion from the Campus.&quot;

&quot;Not only is plagiarism a practice that
is unacceptable, but also it is condemned
in the strongest terms possible on the
basis of moral, educational and legal
grounds. Under University policy, the
offense of plagiarism may be punishable
by a range of penalties up to and including
failure in the course and expulsion
from the University.&quot; <EM>(Undergraduate Bulletin 2004-2006, p.147)</EM>
