Interlibrary Loan assists The University of Southern Mississippi faculty, staff, currently enrolled students, and current Southern Miss Alumni Association members by requesting library materials not available at USM from other institutions. Undergraduate students are limited to five book requests at one time.  Whether an item will be lent by another library is dependent on the policies of that library. Most libraries will lend books, microfilm, and other monographic materials. Journal articles are sent as pdf files. 
</P>

<EM>Items that may be difficult to obtain include: </EM><BR>
Dissertations<BR>
Theses<BR>
Music scores<BR>
Audiovisual materials<BR>
Entire issues or volumes of periodicals<BR>
Newspapers (unless a microfilm is available)<BR>
</P>
<P>
<EM>Items most likely not lent include: </EM><BR>
Old and/or rare books<BR>
Manuscripts and archival materials<BR>
Recently published items<BR>
Textbooks<BR>
Genealogical materials<BR>
Computer software <BR>
Reference books <BR>
</P>
<P>
Materials usually arrive at University Libraries within ten to fourteen working days after a request is submitted. In some instances, the process may take longer. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of interlibrary loan as defined in the National Interlibrary Loan Code is to obtain, for research and serious study, library material not available through local, state, or regional libraries. (National Interlibrary Loan Code, 1980, p.139).

<P>
Each request must be submitted on a separate form, even if two or more articles from the same issue of a journal are being requested. If the form is filled in completely, Interlibrary Loan will be able to process the request faster.

When an item arrives, the Interlibrary Loan staff will contact the patron. E-mail is the primary method of notification. It is the patron&rsquo;s responsibility to make sure the e-mail address in their ILLiad account is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
</FONT></U><H3>Picking Up and Returning Materials</H3>&nbsp;|&nbsp; <U><FONT COLOR=blue>^ top</FONT></U><BR>

<P>
</FONT></U><H3>Electronic Delivery of Articles</H3>&nbsp;|&nbsp; <U><FONT COLOR=blue>^ top</FONT></U><BR>
Interlibrary Loan provides electronic delivery of all articles in PDF format (Adobe&#39;s Portable Document Format). These articles may be accessed from the main menu of ILLiad by selecting &quot;Electronically Received Articles.&quot; This will provide a list of all items that are waiting to be viewed or downloaded. The PDF file can then be accessed by clicking on the transaction number of the document. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic documents will be available via ILLiad for 30 days or until they are deleted by the user.
</P>
<P>
</FONT></U><H3>Length of Loan, Special Terms</H3>&nbsp;|&nbsp; <U><FONT COLOR=blue>^ top</FONT></U><BR>
The length of the loan period for items is determined by the lending library. The lending library may place stipulations on the item. Some of the most common include: no renewals, in library use only, and no photocopying.
</P>
<P>
The lending library may recall an item Interlibrary Loan has borrowed from them. This does not happen often, but if it does, the Interlibrary Loan staff will contact the patron that has the item for an immediate return of the item. 
</P>
<P>
Due dates must be strictly honored. The due date is recorded on the Interlibrary Loan band and is based on the library&rsquo;s allowance. Late returns can jeopardize your borrowing privileges. The borrowing patron is responsible for any fees for lost or overdue materials.
</P>
<P>
Conditions for Interlibrary Loan loans are set by the National Interlibrary Loan Code of the American Library Association and by individual libraries. It is the prerogative of the lending library to set the loan period, refuse to loan materials, withhold permission to photocopy, and/or restrict materials to library use. As the borrowing library, Interlibrary Loan must adhere to all the rules and restrictions of the lending library.

</FONT></U><H3>Requesting a Renewal</H3>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>^ top</FONT></U><BR>
Researchers should make every effort to complete their work with Interlibrary Loan items within the original loan period. As a courtesy, a single renewal per item can usually be obtained. An e-mailed courtesy notice will automatically be generated within five days of the due date. At this point, bring the item to the Interlibrary Loan desk and request a renewal. Unless the lending institution strictly prohibits renewals, the due date will be extended with the understanding that the material is subject to recall by the lending institution at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Renewals cannot be granted over the phone or by e-mail.

</FONT></U><H3>Overdue Materials</H3> &nbsp;|&nbsp;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>^ top</FONT></U><BR>
Interlibrary Loan Services are dependent on cooperation with other institutions. Therefore, adherence to due dates and return policies is important. Patrons can assist in this by returning materials by the due date stated on the white Interlibrary Loan form included with the material. 
</P>
<P>
A charge of $2.00 per day will be assessed by University Libraries for each day that an item is kept past the due date. The overdue fee begins to accrue at the first day past the due date. This charge is applied to the patron&rsquo;s library account. 
</P>
<P>
</FONT></U><H3>Unfilled Requests</H3>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>^ top</FONT></U><BR>
The Interlibrary Loan staff will make every effort to obtain requested material. Although it does not happen often, not all requests can be filled. Occasionally, a request must be sent to numerous libraries before one can be found that is able to supply the requested item. Some requests will require several attempts. A request will only be cancelled when all possible sources have been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
The Interlibrary Loan staff will notify the patron if a request cannot be filled.
