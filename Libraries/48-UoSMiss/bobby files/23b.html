Plagiarism is a serious academic offense!</CENTER>
      <P> The University of Southern 
        Mississippi's student handbook outlines the consequences for plagiarism:</P>
      <P>&quot;When cheating is discovered, the faculty member may give the student 
        an <EM>F on the work</EM> involved <EM>or in the course</EM>. If further disciplinary 
        action is deemed appropriate, the student should be reported to the dean 
        of students. In addition to being a violation of academic honesty, cheating 
        violates the code of student conduct and may be grounds for <EM>probation, 
        suspension, and/or expulsion</EM>.&quot; (USM Student Handbook, 2002-2003)</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>When a student avoids plagiarizing someone else's work, she or he doesn't 
        just avoid doing something wrong. By correctly citing other people's works 
        and ideas, a student has also agreed to engage in the kind of scholarly 
        communication that is part of academic life. Citing another person's words 
        is a way of giving credit to that person, and of acknowledging the importance 
        of that person's work to one's own ideas. After all, you wouldn't want 
        someone quoting your words or using your ideas without giving you credit, 
        would you?</P>
