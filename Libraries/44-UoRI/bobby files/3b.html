    </CENTER><P>The University Libraries consist of the
    Robert L. Carothers Library and Learning Commons in Kingston, the URI Providence Campus Library, and the Pell Marine
    Science Library in Narragansett. </P>
    <P>The Robert L. Carothers Library and Learning Commons functions as the main library in the University Libraries system. It is located on the main campus of the University of Rhode Island in Kingston and sits in the center of campus a short distance from the northwest corner of the Quadrangle. The Library was founded in 1892 and occupied all or part of seven buildings on the campus before moving to its present location in 1964. In 1976, a two-floor addition was constructed, and in 1993 the present structure was completed, with shelf space for 1.4 million volumes and seating for 1300 readers. In 2000, a Mezzanine storage facility was created on Level 3 to house archival materials and lesser-used serial volumes, alleviating crowded conditions in the Lower Level stacks. In May 2009 the building was named in honor of Robert L. Carothers, URI President from 1991 to 2009. In 2011 the building will be renovated to create a state of the art learning commons facility for fostering undergraduate peer learning and collaboration.</P>
    <P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>College of Continuing Education
    Campus Library</FONT></U> is housed in the newly renovated, historic Shepard Building in downtown
    Providence. The CCE Library has supported the information needs of College of Continuing
    Education students since 1945. </P>
    <P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Pell
    Marine Science Library</FONT></U>, located on the University&#146;s Narragansett Bay Campus,
    opened in 1968. The Pell Library provides resources and services that support the
    instructional and research programs at the Bay Campus. The collection emphasizes
    oceanography, marine biology, fisheries, atmospheric chemistry, and coastal and estuarine
    habitats. </P>
    <P>Collectively, the University Libraries hold over 1.1
    million books and receive 8,000 current periodicals. Holdings of government documents,
    audio/visual materials, computer files, manuscripts, archives, maps, nautical charts, and
    microforms amount to nearly 2.3 million additional items. (Additional library <U><FONT COLOR=blue>statistics</FONT></U> are available elsewhere on this site.)</P>
    <P>The University Libraries house a number of specialized
    collections.The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Special
    Collections Unit</FONT></U> in the University Library contains the University Archives; the Rhode
    Island Collection of materials on Rhode Island history; a Rare Book Collection containing
    general interest books as well as those organized around a particular theme, subject, or
    author; a Manuscript Collection of personal papers and records of businesses and
    organizations of Rhode Island interest; and a collection of local history interviews on
    various aspects of Rhode Island life in the twentieth century. The University Library is
    also a depository for federal and state government publications.</P>
    <P>The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>National Sea Grant
    Library</FONT></U> is housed in the Pell Marine Science Library and is a cooperative venture of
    the University of Rhode Island and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA). It was founded in 1971 and has 72,000 documents in its archives and lending
    library. Other special collections at the Pell Library include the scientific reports of
    major oceanographic and polar expeditions since 1873. </P>
    <P>The Libraries&#146; collections can be searched through the
    <U><FONT COLOR=blue>HELIN library catalog</FONT></U>, the shared public access
    catalog of the Higher Education Library Information Network of Rhode Island. HELIN
    includes the libraries of the University of Rhode Island, Bryant College, the Community
    College of Rhode Island, Johnson &amp; Wales University, Providence College, Rhode Island
    College, Roger Williams University, and Salve Regina University. Students and faculty at
    these institutions enjoy reciprocal borrowing privileges. HELIN runs on an Innovative
    Interfaces system. Access to a number of major <U><FONT COLOR=blue>databases</FONT></U>
    and full-text digital publications is offered through the web pages of the University
    Libraries. </P>
        <P>The libraries provide a wide range of services. Research help is available from professional librarians in person and by phone, IM, text messaging, and e-mail. There are several learning labs used for teaching of the University Libraries’ information literacy program in which librarians instruct students in the use of information resources. Computers are available in public areas for research and general use.  </P>
    
    <P>The Library also houses the University’s Information and Instructional Technology Services department which maintains the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library Student Computing Facility</FONT></U>, of approximately 100 workstations for student, staff, and faculty use.  There are copying/ printing/scanning machines located throughout the building. </P>

    and is open to the public. Any Rhode Island resident age 18 or older may borrow material
    from the Libraries, which are open approximately 100 <U><FONT COLOR=blue>hours</FONT></U>

    policies</FONT></U> is available. </P>
