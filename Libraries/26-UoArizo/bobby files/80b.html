/* &quot;Becoming Arizona: The Valentine State&quot; (exhibit)Courtesy of Special CollectionsCover of Arizona, The New State Magazine, Vol. I, No. 4, December 1910Dates: August 22, 2011 - May 30, 2012Location: &nbsp;&nbsp;Special CollectionsContact: Chrystal CarpenterDescription: New exhibit and lecture series celebrate 100 years of Arizona statehood&nbsp; On February 14, 1912, Arizona became the 48th state, and the last of the contiguous states, to join the Union. Known as the &ldquo;Valentine State,&rdquo; Arizona&rsquo;s path to statehood was marked by a pioneering spirit, intermittent achievement and political debate. &ldquo;Becoming Arizona: The Valentine State&rdquo; recreates the colorful story of Arizona&rsquo;s path to statehood. An official Centennial event, this year-long exhibition is on display from Aug. 22 - May 30, 2012 in the gallery at Special Collections, 1510 E. University Blvd. &ldquo;Becoming Arizona&rdquo; features a selection of maps, books, photographs, letters, scrapbooks and unique items selected from Special Collections&rsquo; extensive Southwest and Borderlands holdings. The exhibit documents the experiences and stories that defined the region during the colonial period, territorial times and the years leading up to 1912 statehood. Included in &ldquo;Becoming Arizona&rdquo; is the 1848 Tratado de Paz, the official Mexican printing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Also included is William Oury&rsquo;s handwritten speech that seeks to defend his role in the killing of Apache women and children at the Camp Grant massacre of 1871. A scrapbook compiled by George W.P. Hunt, Arizona&rsquo;s first governor, offers news clippings and photographs that reflect the issues leading up to, and following, Arizona statehood. Unique items on loan from the Arizona Historical Society &ndash; including Wyatt Earp&rsquo;s wedding ring, Geronimo&rsquo;s tinder bag, and a snuff box belonging to Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Salpointe &ndash; complement the materials selected from Special Collections.&ldquo;Becoming Arizona&rdquo; also highlights a number of firsts for the state: the first newspaper printed in Arizona Territory, the Weekly Arizonian, printed in Tubac beginning in 1859; the first book published in the new state, the provisional Arizona Constitution, printed in Tubac in 1860; Arizona Territory&rsquo;s first legal code, the 400-page &ldquo;Howell Code,&rdquo; adopted in 1864; and the establishment of first university, the University of Arizona, in 1885.Curated by Chrystal Carpenter, manuscript and congressional archivist, Erika Casta&ntilde;o, digital archivist, and Roger Myers, librarian, &ldquo;Becoming Arizona: The Valentine State&rdquo; is part of a statewide celebration of the Arizona centennial. A lecture series exploring the literary traditions, political landscape and the legacies of Arizona women will be held throughout the year in conjunction with the exhibit. The exhibit and lecture series are sponsored by the Friends of the University Libraries. AZ Centennial Lecture SeriesAll lectures are located in Special Collections, 1510 E.

His early trips to the Yosemite wilderness in the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s informed the stylistic approach that made him famous. These treks included not only the physical activities of hiking, camping, and mountain climbing, but also social, intellectual, cultural, and spiritual elements.&nbsp;With forty photographs and supporting documents from the Ansel Adams Archive, 'Ansel Adams: The View from Here', curated by Rebecca A. Senf, PhD, Norton Family Curator, explores the relationship between Adams's magical photographs of the American landscape - both its panoramic vistas and its intimate details - and how he came to understand the importance of his natural environment.For more information, please visit http://ccp.library.arizona.edu/Full-page view";
	detailArray[2662] = "&ldquo;Mapping Arizona: From Mexican Territory to U.S. State&rdquo; (exhibit) Geography & Map Division, Library of Congress&nbsp;Detail, map, Territory of Arizona, U.S. Department of the Interior,&nbsp; General Land Office, 1876&nbsp;Dates: January 6, 2012 - March 28, 2012Location: &nbsp;&nbsp;Main LibraryContact: Chris Kollen Description: A new exhibit, &ldquo;Mapping Arizona: From Mexican Territory to U.S. State,&rdquo; offers a visual illustration of Arizona&rsquo;s path to statehood as documented through historical maps of the region. The exhibit, on display in the UA Main Library from Jan. 6 &ndash; March 28, 2012, is one of several exhibits, lectures and events hosted by the University Libraries in celebration of the state&rsquo;s Centennial.An opening lecture and book signing with Thomas Sheridan, a professor in the UA School of Anthropology, will highlight the historical context that shaped Arizona and will draw from Sheridan&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Landscapes of Fraud: Mission Tumac&aacute;cori, the Baca Float, and the Betrayal of the O&rsquo;odham.&rdquo; The lecture, which is free and open to the public, will be held on Jan. 25 from 7:00 p.m. &ndash; 8:30 p.m. in the UA Main Library. &ldquo;Mapping Arizona: From Mexican Territory to U.S. State&rdquo; details the path Arizona took to become a state &ndash; first as part of the Territory of New Mexico, then as the Territory of Arizona, finally attaining statehood in 1912. In addition to an array of historical maps, &ldquo;Mapping Arizona&rdquo; also includes books and unique documents selected from Special Collections extensive holdings. These additional materials offer insight into the stories that accompany the lines, boundaries, and borders within the maps.&nbsp; In addition the maps, the history of private land grants is also highlighted within in the exhibit. Originally granted by the Spanish and then the Mexican government, private land grants, after the Mexican-American War and the Gadsden Purchase, were adjudicated by the U.S. government.&nbsp; Although some of these land grant cases were ruled as attempted fraud, other cases were denied due to technicalities (according to the Treaty of Mesilla, grants had to be &ldquo;located and duly recorded in the Mexican Archives&rdquo;).&ldquo;Mapping Arizona&rdquo; showcases a number of unique items including:-An 1858 map showing the U.S. boundary after the  Treaty of Mesilla and the Gadsden Purchase in 1854. The U.S. boundary  was chosen partly due to mineral wealth, siting of the Southern Pacific  Railroad, and various established white settlements in southern Arizona;-An 1866 map of the Territories of Arizona and New Mexico. It shows  Pah-Ute County in northwestern Arizona that later became part of Nevada;-A 1906 map showing the boundaries of the Baca Float No. 3 land grant  in the Santa Cruz Valley;-A review of the fraudulent claim by James  Reavis for the Peralta land grant. If approved, the Peralta land grant  would have been the largest private land grant in Arizona &ndash; 12 million  acres.An Official AZ Centennial EventFull-page view";

Diaz, San Manuel, Arizona, 1962./Fom the personal collection of Joseph R. DiazDates: January 6, 2012 - March 9, 2012Location: &nbsp;&nbsp;Science-Engineering LibraryContact: Bob DiazDescription: A new exhibit at the UA Science-Engineering Library shares 100 years of stories, struggles and triumphs from Arizona&rsquo;s copper mining communities. &ldquo;Company Town: Arizona&rsquo;s Copper Mining Communities During 100 Years of Statehood,&rdquo; on display from Jan. 6 &ndash; March 9, is one of several exhibits, lectures and events hosted by the University Libraries in celebration of the state&rsquo;s Centennial. The history of mining in Arizona is rich and colorful with silver, gold, and copper all having been discovered and mined in the state. The first mining company in Arizona was established in Ajo in the 1850s. The arrival of the railroad brought a booming industry to Clifton-Morenci, Bisbee and Jerome, all yielding vast quantities of rich copper ore. Throughout the 20th century, while companies like the Phelps-Dodge Corporation made significant profits, the mining workers&rsquo; salary was often not a living wage. Conditions in the mines were dangerous and unhealthy; many miners developed a lung disease now referred to as &ldquo;miner&rsquo;s lung.&rdquo; In this context, labor relations between workers and the mine owners throughout Arizona&rsquo;s history have been volatile, and at times violent. And, as mining was the primary source of economic stability in these communities, when those companies left town so too did the stability and livelihood of entire communities. &ldquo;Company Town&rdquo; features a broad range of unique material selected from Special Collections extensive Southwest and Borderlands holdings, as well as Special Collections mining-related archives. An in-depth selection of photographs, pamphlets, original manuscripts, ephemera, federal and state reports and personal papers illustrates a century of experiences by depicting daily life, health issues, labor disputes and political struggles endemic in Arizona&rsquo;s mining communities. Highlights include photographs from the turn of the century of mining operations in Bisbee, Morenci, and Ajo, as well as original documents, some as early as the 1880s. The materials on display detail the history of eight Arizona mining communities &ndash; Ajo, Bisbee, Clifton-Morenci, Globe-Miami, Jerome, Ray-Sonora, San Manuel and Superior &ndash; and show that these communities were more than just a mine, and the people more than just mining workers.One community in particular, Clifton-Morenci, was the epicenter of the Arizona copper mine strike of 1983. Anna Ochoa O&rsquo;Leary, a professor in the UA department of Mexican American and Raza Studies, lived in Clifton during the strike and was the president of the Morenci Miners Women's Auxiliary in Clifton from 1985 to 1986. Professor Ochoa O&rsquo;Leary will deliver a closing lecture recalling those experiences as well as sharing the stories of life and family in Arizona&rsquo;s mining communities from a female perspective. The lecture, which is free and open to the public, will be held on March 6 from 3:00 &ndash; 4:30 p.m. in the UA Science-Engineering Library.Full-page view";
