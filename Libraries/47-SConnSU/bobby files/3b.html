<H2>Announcement:</H2>
<P ALIGN="center"><EM>H.C. BULEY LIBRARY INTERLIBRARY LOANS: <BR>
</EM><EM>REQUEST IT! TRACK IT! GET IT! </EM></P>
<P>Buley Library is introducing a new interlibrary loan service that will make it easier for you to initiate and track your Interlibrary Loan requests. The system is called ILLiad and can be accessed from on-campus or at home through our Web interface. ILLIad offers advanced features such as viewing your outstanding Interlibrary Loans, receiving e-mail notification of received ILL requests and cancellations, and renewing all library items without staff assistance. </P>
<P>How do you get started? Library patrons must first register and establish a personal profile. Once the system is active, you will login  with your University network User ID and Password. Once this is completed, you can immediately request journal articles, book chapters, books, or dissertations. ILLiad is free for all SCSU students, faculty and staff. We're hoping that this service will exceed your expectations and will save you time and improve access to research materials.
</P>
<H2>About Interlibrary Loan (ILL): </H2>
<P>Interlibrary loan services are available for SCSU students, staff, and faculty who need books and journal articles not found at Buley Library or in the Connecticut State University Library System. Library patrons should check our <U><FONT COLOR=blue>CONSULS Online Catalog</FONT></U> to determine if one of the libraries in the system owns the material. Books and other materials can be requested through the intralibrary loan system or by going directly to the library. Journal articles must be requested through ILL and by filling out the ILL form. Interlibrary loan is not available for library patrons with guest borrowing privileges. </P>
<P>  Materials requested through interlibrary loan are searched through OCLC, a national automated interlibrary loan system. Most of the time book requests can be located from Connecticut or regional libraries and will be shipped within 5-10 business days. Books coming from other states may take up to two weeks or longer to arrive. Our Loan Department will process these requests and place at the Circulation Desk for pickup. </P>
<P>  Journal article requests may take less time to arrive and can be delivered to your desktop electronically, mailed to your home or campus address. All journal articles are considered your personal copies and can be kept by you. </P>
<P>  The Interlibrary Loan Department will process only five requests, per patron, per day during the busy periods. </P>
<H2>Renewals</H2>
<P>  If you need additional time for the ILL material that you have checked out, <U><FONT COLOR=blue>login to the ILL system</FONT></U> and request a renewal. The lending library will be contacted to see if they will allow renewals.</P>
<H2>  Overdue Fines</H2>
<P>  Library patrons will be held responsible for any lost or damaged material. You will be responsible for any overdue fines charged by the lending library.</P>
