  <P ALIGN="left">The mission 
    of Hilton C. Buley Library&#8217;s Reference Department is to provide quality reference 
    service to the University community in a professional and timely manner, to 
    develop and maintain a collection of print and electronic resources that support 
    the learning, teaching and research needs of the university, and to instruct 
    individuals, groups, and classes on the retrieval and effective use of information 
    sources.</P>
  <P ALIGN="left">In order 
    to provide quality reference service to the University community, the Reference 
    Desk is staffed by a reference librarian most (not all) <U><FONT COLOR=blue> 
    hours</FONT></U> the library is open. Reference librarians use the most effective 
    innovative and traditional techniques in providing information, and instruct 
    patrons in the value and use of the library's collections. The department 
    recognizes that patron information needs and demands require that Reference 
    staff members possess substantial capabilities and competencies and will strive 
    to serve patrons with knowledge, alertness, accuracy, and speed.</P>
  <P ALIGN="left">The basic 
    objective of the department is to provide direct support of the University 
    curriculum through answering the research questions of patrons and by providing 
    current, easily-accessible materials to answer those queries. In meeting the 
    patron needs, the Reference Department follows standards presented in <U><FONT COLOR=blue> 
    &quot;Information Services for Information Consumers: Guidelines for Providers&quot;</FONT></U>, 
    prepared by the American Library Association in June, 1990. The department 
    regularly reviews its guidelines for both the subject scope of the Reference 
    Collection and the types of materials included in it. Also, it aims to set 
    procedures for acquiring new materials and for weeding the collection to ensure 
    the development and maintenance of a complete, current, and convenient Reference 
    Collection. </P>

  <P ALIGN="left">The Reference 
    Department strives to maintain a quality reference collection consisting of 
    books and electronic products.&nbsp; Reference librarians select materials

    the <U><FONT COLOR=blue> subject selectors</FONT></U> to maintain an authoritative, 
    current, and comprehensive reference collection that serves the university 
    community effectively and adequately. The basic subject areas that are collected 
    are those that support the instructional and research activities of the university 
    community.&nbsp;</P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><EM>Print

  600 are on the first floor. Books with call numbers RC 601 through Z are on
  the second floor.&nbsp;</P>
  <P ALIGN="left">Materials 
    in this collection are limited to almanacs, dictionaries, (English language,

    general bibliographies and specialized subject bibliographies), basic texts 
    with high reference value, statistical/table compilations, biographical sources, 
    manuals, yearbooks, atlases, loose-leaf services, indexes and guides to research.</P>

    The ready reference

    include those reference sources that are used frequently to answer reference/information 
    questions. Most of these materials are basic reference books such as almanacs, 
    desk reference sources, dictionaries, directories, statistical sources, style 
    guides, resume/job sources, thesaurus, etc. This section also has some frequently 
    consulted books pertaining to information on Connecticut in the areas of Budget, 
    Business, Census, Crime, Economy, Education, Geography, Government, Health, 
    Social Services and Statistics. Connecticut telephone books and the Library 
  of Congress Subject Heading volumes are also part of this collection. </P>
  Patrons are requested to 
  return these materials to the Reference Desk after use.  
  <P ALIGN="left"><EM>Map

    The goal for the SCSU Map Collection is to acquire, house, organize, and maintain 
    maps and related materials needed to support the teaching and research programs 
    of the University. All maps are kept in map cabinets in the alcove on the
  main floor near the restrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp; US topographic maps, US Geological Survey 
    Maps, all state series and park series maps as well as maps from the US Defense 
    Mapping Agency belong

    in this collection. Please go to the Reference desk for assistance.</P>
  <P ALIGN="left">A representative 
    collection of general and specialized atlases are available. The latest editions

      <P ALIGN="left">The Reference 
        Department strives to maintain a quality collection of print reference 
        resources. Reference librarians are responsible for maintaining an authoritative, 
        current, and comprehensive reference collection that serves the University 
        community effectively and adequately. The basic subject areas that are 
        collected are those that serve to support the instructional programs and 
        research needs of the University community. The collection is available 
        to non-affiliated users. The materials vary in scope and depth of coverage, 
        in point of view and complexity to meet the needs of the largest number 
        of library users.</LI>
    <LI> 
      <P ALIGN="left">A reference 
        book is one that by virtue of its format, arrangement, or content is consulted 
        for bibliographic or factual information rather than read in its entirety. 
        Almost all of the books in Buley Library's reference section fit this 
        definition.&nbsp; However, some books that do not meet this definition 
        are shelved in this collection because of their usefulness in answering 
        reference questions. The level of collection varies from subject to subject 
        depending on the courses being taught at the institution and the budget 
        allocated for the department.&nbsp; Factors influencing the selection 
        of reference materials are the currency of the material, the usefulness 
        of the material in relation to existing materials in the collection, the 
        targeted audience, the reputation of author or publisher and book reviews.</LI>
    <LI> 
      <P ALIGN="left">Print 
        materials in the Reference collection consist of almanacs, bibliographies 
        (standard, general, and subject specific), biographical sources, concordances, 
        dictionaries (English language, foreign language, and subject dictionaries), 
        general encyclopedias, specific subject encyclopedias, geographical sources 
        (atlases, gazetteers, maps), guidebooks, handbooks, loose leaf materials, 
        manuals, newspaper and periodical indexes and abstracts, pamphlets, statistical/table 
        compilations, basic texts with high reference value, and yearbooks. Government 
        documents are included in the Reference collection if their content falls 
        within the criteria of reference materials.&nbsp;</LI>
    <LI> 
      <P ALIGN="left">The Reference 
        Department aims to collect both current and retrospective materials.&nbsp; 
        The emphasis is on current materials but older materials are purchased 
        depending on the information content and the availability of funds. Only 
        one copy of a title is ordered. Exceptions are made to ensure the availability 
        of heavily used materials. Reference books are ordered in hard copy format 
        with the exception of those items that are withdrawn annually when the 
        newer editions are received.</LI>
    <LI> 
      <P ALIGN="left">Most 
        reference books are ordered through a vendor. A few are ordered directly 
        from publishers. Some titles are placed on a standing order list. Standing 
        order&nbsp; titles include materials that need to be current to be useful, 
        such as directories, almanacs, yearbooks, etc., as well as materials published 
        on a particular cycle that we choose to order on a particular schedule 
        reflecting information needs and budgetary constraints.&nbsp; Titles on 
        this list will be reviewed annually for additions, deletions, and changes

        products available on the web, products that accommodate IP authentication 
        from any SCSU IP, including the proxy server for remote access, are given
