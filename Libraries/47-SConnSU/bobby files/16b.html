<P><EM><EM> Beginning in 2000, the library formally adopted the liaison model of collection development by matching librarians with academic departments. Currently, each academic area of the university has been assigned a librarian liaison who works with the classroom faculty to develop the library resources and instructional programs that will best serve the students in each area.&nbsp; Faculty members are encouraged to be in touch with their liaison through email and by telephone with suggestions for library purchases, requests for library instruction or any other concerns or comments regarding the library.&nbsp; Together, the librarian liaisons make up Buley's Collection Development Committee, with responsibility for building a collection of library resources that meets the research needs of the university community.&nbsp;</EM></EM> <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <EM>Please Note: In general, orders are processed in the order in which they are received.&nbsp; As soon as the order is placed it is visible in CONSULS (the on-line library catalog) and its progress from order to shelf can be tracked by anyone who is interested.&nbsp; Many items are received within 4 weeks of being ordered, most items are in the library within 8 weeks.&nbsp; Faculty members are welcome to ask for any item that is &#8220;in process&#8221; to be rushed through the catalog process&#8212;it will generally be available within a day of such a request.&nbsp; Also, if there is some extenuating circumstance that kept a professor from ordering an item in a timely manner, the professor should request a rush order through his or her liaison.&nbsp; Each such request will be considered individually (and must fall within the parameters of the library's Collection Development Policy ).&nbsp; Please be aware that rush orders can incur significant additional expense and can quickly deplete the budgeted amount for a department.&nbsp; At any time recent purchases can be viewed through this web page.</EM>

<P></FONT></U><EM>INTRODUCTION</EM> </P>
<P>Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) provides educational opportunities to over 12,000 full and part time students. This public university, which began as a normal school in 1893, has a rich tradition as an educator of teachers.&nbsp; The University has grown and diversified over the past 50 years and now offers curricula leading to bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s degrees in the arts and sciences, as well as in a variety of professional areas, including nursing, library science, social work, and business.&nbsp; Sixth year professional diplomas are also awarded in several subjects. </P>
<P>Building the collection involves balancing the needs of library users, evaluating the vast pool of published information, exploring emerging avenues of information dissemination, allocating limited resources, and communicating with the library&#8217;s constituency regarding goals and objectives of university programs and resources of the library. </P>
<P>This collection development policy for Hilton C. Buley Library guides the library and classroom faculty in building a quality collection of resources to support the academic endeavors of the Southern Connecticut State University community, in a planned, systematic way. </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>BULEY LIBRARY MISSION STATEMENT</EM> </P>
<P>The mission of the Hilton C. Buley Library is to develop, organize, preserve, and provide access to a collection of books and other recorded resources of the University, and to provide access to needed information located elsewhere.&nbsp; The Library directs its services and programs to University students, faculty, staff and Connecticut residents, and provides access to other institutions of higher education world-wide. </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTION</EM> </P>
<P>The contractual responsibilities of the library faculty as defined in the AAUP Collective Bargaining Agreement, 1999-2001, include the development and maintenance of the library collection. </P>
<P>&nbsp;<EM>Responsibilities include:&nbsp; &#8220;&#8230;developing and maintaining the library collection of the university, providing bibliographic services (access to recorded information) to the university community, providing bibliographic instruction to students, and advising faculty, scholars and the community in the use of these collections.&#8221;</EM> <BR>
      <EM>CSU AAUP Collective Bargaining Agreement, article 8.3 1997-2001</EM> </P>
<P>All Buley Library librarians are involved in collection development.&nbsp; In addition, each academic area of the university has been assigned a <U><FONT COLOR=blue>librarian subject specialist</FONT></U>.&nbsp; This librarian works with the classroom faculty to develop the library resources and instructional programs that best serve the students in each area.&nbsp; Classroom faculty are encouraged to communicate to their librarian suggestions for library purchases, requests for library programming and any other concerns or comments regarding the library.&nbsp; In addition, it is expected that each academic department will appoint a representative to bring together department requests and concerns and communicate them to the subject specialist. </P>
<P>Ultimately, responsibility for building the library collection lies with the library faculty. </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>SELECTION CRITERIA</EM> </P>
<P>Materials are selected according to the needs of the SCSU academic community,&nbsp; scope and content,&nbsp; subject strength, quality, timeliness, bibliographic accessibility, cost, language and country of origin. At times there may be a concerted effort to work on a particular area of the collection.&nbsp; In addition, new faculty members are given the opportunity to suggest materials for purchase that are relevant to their specific strengths or areas of study.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific guidelines for collection acquisitions include: </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Materials that directly meet student curricular needs. Textbooks for courses offered by the University are not ordinarily purchased. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Instructional preparation materials. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Faculty development materials. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Faculty research materials in areas where there are academic programs will be considered. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Representative works of high caliber which might arouse intellectual curiosity, counteract parochialism, help to develop critical thinking and cultural appreciation, or stimulate use of library resources for continuing education and personal development; <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Special collections of historical interest. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Expenditures that fall within the budgeted amount in the departmental allocated materials budget.&nbsp; (Requests that exceed the allocated budget amount are subject to the approval of the Collection Development Librarian or the director.) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Materials only in those languages in which academic programs are taught or in which faculty and students must read and conduct research. (In subject areas other than &#8220;languages&#8221; and &#8220;literature,&#8221; the library emphasizes the acquisitions of English-language&nbsp; materials.) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Single copies of titles.&nbsp; (Two copies may be purchased if needed.&nbsp; More than two copies require approval of the Collection Development Librarian.) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. Hardbound books preferred.&nbsp; (There are cases when paperbound books are appropriate&#8212;including informational works with short lifespans and multiple copies.) </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>CONTROVERSIALITY STATEMENT</EM> </P>
<P>The Buley Library Faculty recognize and affirm the role of libraries in fostering intellectual freedom and the freedom of expression as guaranteed by the First Amendment.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the Library Faculty to collect materials that represent various points of view on issues and questions of our times without endorsement, restriction or prejudice. </P>
<P>When a library user deems material to be objectionable, he or she should address a signed, written complaint to the Library Director.&nbsp; The director will review the material in partner with the Collection Development Committee in light of present selection criteria and collection development objectives.&nbsp; The complainant shall receive a written reply from the Director indicating the library&#8217;s position. </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>THE ALLOCATED BUDGET</EM> </P>
<P>A portion of the materials budget is allocated to various spending areas that generally correspond to academic departments. The allocation formula is based on a number of variables. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The size of a department in faculty and student majors <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The nature of material needed to support a department (ex. subscriptions, monographs, rare materials, on-line services, etc.) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Record of expenditure in relation to budget in previous years <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Extent of university requirements from one department <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. New initiatives, including degrees, programs, majors, and targeted efforts </P>
<P>Departments are informed of the allocation for library spending in their area early in the academic year. Subject liaisons and department liaisons work together to build the library collection in each area. </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>ACQUISITION STRATEGIES</EM> </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Acquisition Department receives faculty and librarian requests for materials through the subject specialists and places orders with the appropriate vendors.&nbsp; If complete bibliographic information is not supplied the acquisition staff will clarify the citation before placing the order.&nbsp; Library materials are acquired through approval plans, firm orders, standing orders and gifts. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Approval plans include arrangements by which a publisher or wholesale vendor ships titles or &#8220;slips&#8221; according to a specified profile that will likely meet the needs of the library.&nbsp; The library reviews the items to either retain or return them and places orders or not from publication notifications. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Firm Orders are placed in response to individual, specific item requests generated by the instrucational faculty or librarians and forwarded through librarian subject liaisons. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Standing Orders are maintained for a wide variety of materials including monographic series and periodical publications.&nbsp; They insure timely acquisition of current materials and guard against gaps. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Gifts are often welcome additions to the library collection and are always accepted with the understanding that their disposition can not be determined by the donor.&nbsp; The library assumes all rights of ownership of any donation.&nbsp; After careful review gifts may be added to the collection, donated to other libraries, sold or discarded. </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>COLLECTION MAINTENANCE</EM> </P>
<P>Inventory </P>
<P>Inventory of the library&#8217;s circulating collection is an on-going endeavor that takes place primarily during low circulation periods during the academic year&#8212;especially summer and winter break periods.&nbsp; It is expected that the entire collection will be inventoried over the course of a two year period, every five years.&nbsp; During the interim periods specific collections or subject areas will be inventoried as needed.&nbsp; The primary purpose of the inventory is to identify titles that appear in the catalog but can not be physically accounted for.&nbsp; In addition, decisions regarding the replacement of worn out or damaged materials will be made at this time in accordance with the selection criteria in the collection development policy. </P>
<P>Deacquisition </P>
<P>Deacquisition, or weeding, is also an on-going endeavor that is the responsibility of the subject liaisons with assistance from all librarians.&nbsp; The library collection is constantly reviewed for compliance with the collection development selection criteria laid out in this document.&nbsp; Materials that no longer meet the criteria will be removed form the shelves for review.&nbsp; After careful consideration, with input from classroom faculty, titles may be removed from the collection. </P>
<P>Preservation </P>
<P>The Library promotes preservation as an integral part of the maintenance of the collections and is governed by prevailing practice and official standards in regard to storage, handling and display of materials.&nbsp; Preservation is coordinated with relevant departments and subject specialists to assure that goals are met in a systematic manner.&nbsp; Enhanced consideration is given to the rare or unique, items of great significance; and materials of special interest. <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>COLLECTIONS</EM> </P>
<P>Selection and holdings for all collections will follow the same principles underlying the general collection development policy selection criteria outlined above. </P>
<P><EM>NOTE: Locations are subject to change due to the temporary relocation of materials during construction of the Buley Library addition and renovation. Staff will be happy to direct you to current stack locations. This page will be updated following the spring, 2008 move to temporary quarters in the new addition. </EM></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buley Library shares building space with the University Gallery.&nbsp; Although the gallery is not part of the library, much of its <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collection is of interest to library users and select objects from the gallery are generally displayed on the library floors. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The collection is strong in West African art.&nbsp; The University Gallery is under the supervision of its director and has its <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own catalog. </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>LIBRARY MATERIAL FORMATS</EM> </P>
<P>&nbsp;Selection and holdings for all formats will follow the same principles underlying the general collection development selection <BR>
  criteria outlined above. </P>
<P><EM>Monographs</EM> </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Binding: Hardbound books are preferred though paperbacks will not be excluded from the collection.&nbsp; In many cases, costs saving will be realized by binding new paperbacks.&nbsp; In cases where the subject matter may become quickly obsolete the paperback version of a title will be purchased. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Textbooks:&nbsp; Textbooks generally do not have lasting value or new, unique subject insights and are not purchased by the library.&nbsp; Occasionally, upper level and graduate level texts fill a void in the collection. Such texts will be purchased judiciously. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Dissertations &amp; Theses: The library collects one copy of each master&#8217;s thesis and honors college thesis written by SCSU students in completion of their degrees.&nbsp; In addition, dissertations in various subject areas are purchased.&nbsp; Collections of dissertations in specific academic fields may be purchased in micro format. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.Accompanying computer disks or CD-ROMs:&nbsp; If a book meets the general selection criteria purchase is made regardless of accompanying electronic material.&nbsp; The book and accompanying material may be physically separated to insure security; both will be represented in the CONSULS database. </P>
<P><EM>Periodicals</EM> </P>
<P>In addition to meeting the general collection development principles, purchase recommendations will be considered in light of the following criteria: </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Appropriateness of subject matter to the collection <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Accuracy of content <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Accessibility through indexes available at SCSU <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.Frequency with which serial is cited by the literature <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.Representation of a point of view or subject needed in the collection <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.Anticipated use in relation to cost </P>
<P><EM>Indexes and Abstracts</EM> </P>
<P>The collection of indexes and abstracts provides access to periodical literature.&nbsp; Selection is based on the needs of the curriculum and an effort is made to closely align the index collection coverage to current library journal selections. </P>
<P><EM>Print Journals &amp; Indexes:</EM> </P>
<P>The Library is moving towards complete electronic access to journals.&nbsp; The transition period is expected to last many years. There is constant evaluation of the print journal collection including on-going journal use studies.&nbsp; Librarians monitor both use and content of electronic and print versions of serial titles. New print subscriptions are purchased only when there is no electronic version or the print version is otherwise justifiable. </P>
<P><EM>Electronic Journals</EM> </P>
<P>An electronic journal subscription is subject to evaluation according to the criteria for evaluation of periodicals listed above. Additional considerations include: </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Accessibility through the world wide web <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Availability of journal in full text through database aggregator <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Availability of electronic archive <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.Licensing issues and vendor support <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.Quality of non-text images <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.Technical requirements <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.Ease of on-site printing &amp; downloading </P>
<P><EM>Electronic Books</EM> </P>
<P>The library is currently experimenting with the incorporation of ebooks into the collection. Preference is given to products that are accessible via the world wide web. Electronic books are generally purchased as collections.&nbsp; Preference will be given to vendors who make available accompanying catalog records.&nbsp; Other criteria to be considered are: </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Cost <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Quality <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Ease of use <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.Technical support requirements <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.Compatibility with existing library systems <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.Comprehensiveness <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.Staff training requirements <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.Licensing restrictions <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P><EM>Cd-rom or Diskettes</EM> </P>
<P>A resource only available on cd-rom or diskette&nbsp; will be considered only if it is a unique resource meeting a specific information <BR>
  need. </P>
<P><EM>Electronic Databases</EM> </P>
<P>On-line Indexes and full-text products greatly improve access to information formerly in printed&nbsp; sources or not available.&nbsp; The library prefer s on-line data bases accessible via the world wide web.&nbsp; In addition to meeting general collection development policy guidelines purchase decisions will take into consideration: </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Scope (size, coverage and time span) of a product <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Content (arrangement, abstracts, full text) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Accessibility (number of access points and ease of access) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.Accompanying materials </P>
<P><EM>Newspapers</EM> </P>
<P>Newspapers are selected to meet general reference and informational needs of the University community.&nbsp; Printed newspapers will be selected to cover regional and national interests. With the exception of those newspapers retained on microfilm, papers are kept for a limited period of time. </P>
<P>The library will provide access to electronic newspapers whenever possible through home page links to direct subscriptions or electronic resource aggregators. </P>
<P><EM>Internet Resources</EM> </P>
<P>When a web site meets the overall collection development criteria set out in this document access to the site may be created through the CONSULS catalog or via an individual librarian&#8217;s web page or the Buley Library Home Page.&nbsp; The technical services staff is responsible for maintaining and correcting links that appear in the CONSULS catalog. </P>
<P><EM>Microforms</EM> </P>
<P>Microforms are an integral part of the collection.&nbsp; Back files of many periodicals are available. The selection criteria applied to printed materials also apply to microforms.&nbsp; Only micro formats that can be supported with existing equipment will be purchased. Microforms may be acquired for the following reasons: </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Collections are available only in microform <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Ease of storage <BR>

<P></FONT></U><EM>GIFT POLICY</EM> <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P>Introduction </P>
<P>&nbsp;The Hilton C. Buley Library recognizes that gifts play an important role in building the library collection and often accepts gifts. Donations may be in the form of&nbsp; library materials or funding for library materials.&nbsp;&nbsp; Library materials that are given must meet the overall collection development policy before being added to the collection. </P>
<P>Material Gifts <BR>
&nbsp;The library will accept gifts of library materials at the discretion of the Director of Library Services, with the understanding that no conditions to acceptance will be recognized.&nbsp; The library administration reserves the right to determine the retention, location, cataloging treatment, and other considerations relevant to a gift&#8217;s use or disposal.&nbsp; Commonly, a donation of books will not be added to the library&nbsp; as a cohesive collection, but will be distributed throughout the library in accordance with the library classification scheme in use.&nbsp; (Records may be marked in the on-line catalog to allow the generation of specific gift bibliographies.)&nbsp; Other materials will be dispersed in the manner most appropriate to their format.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P> The library will request that any large donation of library materials be accompanied by financial resources to allow their timely cataloging and processing.&nbsp; A title list should be presented with any donation&nbsp; The donor is advised to include name, address,&nbsp; date and content notes on each container of materials.&nbsp; Donated materials should be in good physical condition. </P>
<P>The library will not accept responsibility for picking up donations.&nbsp; When the donated materials and list are submitted, the gift will be acknowledged with a letter from the Library Director.&nbsp; If the donor submits no list, the Library Director will acknowledge only the number of items received. <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P>Procedures for accepting gifts of materials </P>
<P>1. Donors are asked to read and sign the gift policy statement document and acknowledge that they have a clear understanding <BR>
  of the policy. <BR>
  2. Gifts are accepted without condition. <BR>
  3. A record of donor&#8217;s name, address and gift particulars is forwarded to the director for acknowledgement. <BR>
  4. Gifts are sorted as to whether appropriate or not for Buley&#8217;s collection. <BR>
  5. Appropriate gifts are searched in CONSULS and sorted as to &#8220;owned&#8221; or &#8220;not owned.&#8221; <BR>
  6. Gifts not owned by Buley are sent to subject liaison librarians for final approval or disapproval. <BR>
  7. Approved gifts are sent to cataloging and added to the collection. <BR>
  8. Gifts already owned by Buley library may be exchanged for shelved titles if gift is in better condition. <BR>
  9. Gifts not approved for addition to Buley&#8217;s collection&nbsp; may be sold, traded, donated to another library or discarded. </P>
<P>Appraisal </P>
<P>&nbsp;The Library can not establish the value of a donation for income tax or any other purposes.&nbsp; Donor&#8217;s should secure a gift appraisal&nbsp; from an independent agent prior to making their donation. </P>
<P>Monetary Gifts <BR>
&nbsp;Library will work in conjunction with the University Development Office to accept monetary gifts.&nbsp; Donors may specify certain titles for purchase or may request that spending be focused on certain areas within the curricula and research fields of the University.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any materials purchased must meet collection development criteria.&nbsp; The Library will reject monetary gifts specified for buying materials that fall outside the range of the Collection Development Policy. <BR>

<P>APPENDIX D </P>
<P></FONT></U><EM>DEACCESSION POLICY</EM> </P>
<P>Introduction </P>
<P>&nbsp;Deaccession is the on-going process of removing items from the library collection that are not within the parameters of collection criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject liaisons are responsible for deaccessioning according to the subject criteria for their areas.&nbsp; Discard of materials is a regular activity and may be done in cooperation with other librarians and staff, and the classroom faculty. Special attention is focused during major shifts, inventory, reclassification projects, and periods of low use. <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P>Guidelines for Weeding </P>
<P>A. Physical Condition <BR>
  Materials which are worn or damaged will be considered for replacement.&nbsp; When an item is in such poor physical condition that it cannot be refurbished, its worth to the collection will be evaluated.&nbsp; If the content is still of value it will be replaced; if it is not replaceable, it will be considered for protected storage.&nbsp; If the content is not relevant to the collection the item will be discarded. </P>
<P>B. Duplication <BR>
  Multiple copies are not retained in the collection except in the case of heavy use or special request by a faculty member. </P>
<P>C. Content <BR>
  Material that contains information that is obsolete, and is not of historic value, will be considered for deaccession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Materials of signal historical, artistic or bibliographical interest will be considered for inclusion in special collections. </P>
<P>D. Editions <BR>
  Different editions of the same title are evaluated in the context of the subject area.&nbsp; Older editions will be considered for discard. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Disposition of Weeded Material </P>
<P>&nbsp;Materials that are weeded from the collection may be discarded, recycled, traded, given away or sold.&nbsp; The <BR>
  Acquisitions/Collection Development Librarian is responsible for determining the best way to dispose of weeded materials. <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<P>Procedures for de-accession can be found in the Technical Services Procedures manual. <BR>
