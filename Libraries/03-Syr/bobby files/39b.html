      <H3>Vera House White Ribbon Campaign presentation on March 8th</H3>
      
        
          <P><U><FONT COLOR=blue></FONT></U>In support of the campus-wide <EM><EM>White Ribbon Campaign</EM></EM>, Syracuse University Library will host a presentation by <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Vera House</FONT></U> representatives at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday, March 8th in the Peter Graham Scholarly Commons, located on the first floor of Bird Library.   The event is free and open to the campus community.  </P>

<P>Vera House's <EM><EM>White Ribbon Campaign</EM></EM> is led primarily by concerned men who encourage and invite all members of the community -- men and women, young and old--to pin on a ribbon and join them in raising awareness and funds to end domestic and sexual violence. This male leadership helps to acknowledge the important contributions men have made to this effort and invites others to play a role.</P>

<P>Speaker Chauncey D. Brown is Men's Outreach Program Coordinator at Vera House. He has ten years of experience in the field of domestic violence prevention. Using the "12 Men Model" launched in 2009, the Vera House program is designed to challenge the beliefs and attitudes of men who have been abusive in their relationships.</P>

<P>International victims advocate Monira Alozaime has worked with Vera House for about three years. Her specialty is working with people from countries outside the United States who have been victims of domestic violence.  Monira not only helps people through their particular domestic violence situation, but also assists them in obtaining green cards, citizenship, or other issues pertaining to their current status in the United States.  </P>

<P>During the week of March 5 - 9, Bird Library will also provide a resource section adjacent to the new book area to showcase the Library's wealth of resources on domestic violence.  Handouts from Vera House, the LGBT Center, and other campus outreach programs will also be available in the Learning Commons.<BR>
