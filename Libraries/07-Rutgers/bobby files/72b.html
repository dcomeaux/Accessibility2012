Go to the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U>  webpage, login with your  NetID,
and register. After the initial registration, log on with your NetID to submit and  review
the status of requests, and receive electronically delivered documents.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>Why do I need to log in with my NetID  to  use  Interlibrary  Loan  and  Article  Delivery
Services?</H2>



<P>
Logging on with your Rutgers NetID username and password  allow  us  to  give  you  secure
access to information about your interlibrary loan requests. In  addition,  you  can  edit
your personal information such as your email and pickup library information.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>

Eligible emeritus faculty, visiting scholars, UMDNJ, Rowan-CCC, retirees, and faculty 
research assistants may login with their library barcode and PIN.

<U><FONT COLOR=blue>create an OIT account and NetID</FONT></U>.

faculty. Use your NetID to login for your personal interlibrary loan and article  delivery
activity.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>What Web browser should I use?</H2>



<P>
You need a Web browser that can handle forms, tables, and, preferably, one that can handle
frames, for example, Internet Explorer version 5.0 or greater.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>Is security a problem if I use a public workstation?</H2>



<P>
It might be. When using a public access workstation exit from the Web browser  before  you
leave the workstation. This prevents the Back button from accessing  the  pages  you  were
using.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How do I request an article from a journal that's at a Rutgers library? How do  I  request
an article from a journal that's not at Rutgers?</H2>



<P>
Logon to <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U>  and under New Request select  the
[Article Request] form. Use this form to request  articles  from  journals  at  a  Rutgers
library and articles from journals not owned by Rutgers.  Include  as  much  bibliographic
information as possible. Required fields are indicated with a *.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>My article citation does not contain information for a required field. How can  I  request
it?</H2>



<P>
If you are unable to locate information for a required field,  enter  "NA"  and  click  on
[Submit Request].
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>What happens to my request for a Rutgers article if a Rutgers library can't fill it?</H2>



<P>
If a journal article owned by Rutgers is missing  or  otherwise  not  available,  we  will
attempt to get it for you  on  interlibrary  loan  from  another  library.  Law  students,
faculty, and staff will be referred back to their law school library for interlibrary loan
services.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How do I place a request for a book?</H2>



<P>
Logon to <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U>  and under New Request select  the
[ILL Book Request] form. Use this form to request a book, dissertation, score,  newspaper,
or an item on microform that is not owned by Rutgers. Before you place  a  request  for  a
book on interlibrary loan, be sure to search the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library Catalog</FONT></U> and the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>PALCI</FONT></U>  (E-ZBorrow)  catalog  and
request faster delivery yourself.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>Can I order chapters from books?</H2>


<P>
Pages and chapters in circulating books are not eligible for the article  delivery  service.  Please  request  delivery  of
circulating books using the "Book Delivery/Recall" button in the Library Catalog.
</P>


 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How do I place a request for a conference proceeding?</H2>



<P>
Logon to <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U> and under New Request select  the
[ILL Conference Proceedings Request] form. Include as much  bibliographic  information  as
possible.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How do I update a request with new or additional information?</H2>



<P>
Logon to Interlibrary Loan and Article  Delivery  Services  and  under  View  select  your
Outstanding Requests file. Click on the transaction number of  the  request  you  want  to
update, and then click on the [Edit Request] button.  Update  your  request  with  new  or
additional citation information and then click on [Submit Request].
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How many requests can I submit at one time?</H2>



<P>
There is no limit on the number of requests you can submit. However, if you submit a large
number, you may be asked by interlibrary loan staff to prioritize your requests.  You  may
also find it useful to phase in the requests over a period of time rather than submit them
all at once. Staggering the delivery over a longer time frame will give you more  time  to
work with individual items.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How do I check on the status of my requests?</H2>



<P>
Log on to <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U> webpage. You will see a list  of
your outstanding requests on the main menu. You may also select All  Requests  under  View
for a comprehensive list of requests. Click on a request's transaction number to view  its
Transaction Information. Scroll down to Tracking where you  will  see  the  date/time  and
status of the request every time it is updated by interlibrary loan staff.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>What do the Request Statuses mean?</H2>



<P>
The Request Statuses inform you of where your  request  is  as  it  moves  through  the  request
process. If you're curious as to what a specific Request Status  means,  see  
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Statuses</FONT></U> 
or write to <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Ask a Librarian</FONT></U>.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>Is there a fee for getting an article from another Rutgers library?</H2>



<P>
There is no charge to you for articles delivered from any Rutgers library. 
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How much will interlibrary loan materials cost me?</H2>



<P>
Currently there is no charge to you for interlibrary loan items unless  the  cost  of  the
loan or copy exceeds $20. You will be notified before the request is  made  if  there  are
charges to you beyond the $20 cap.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How can I cancel an ILL or article delivery request?</H2>



<P>
Locate the request and click on its transaction number. Select the [Cancel Request] button
at the top of the Transaction Information screen. Cancelled requests are listed under View
/ Cancelled  Requests.  You  will  receive  email  notification  whenever  the  Libraries'
interlibrary loan staff cancels a request.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How do I reinstate a cancelled request?</H2>



<P>
If you cancelled a request in error, select the Canceled Requests queue under View on  the
main menu. Click on the request's transaction number. Select the [Resubmit Request] button
at the top of the Transaction Information screen.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How will I know when my ILL book is ready to pickup?</H2>



<P>
You will receive notification at the email address currently on file with the  university  in
the Rutgers Online Directory when interlibrary loan books arrive at your pickup  library  and
are ready to check out. Note, this may be a different email address than  you  registered  in
your "Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery" account. . You will also be notified about  ILL
book availability in your MY ACCOUNT file in the Library Catalog under  "Review  Library Catalog  Requests,  Holds  and
Recalls."
</P>

<P>
If you requested delivery to an off-campus pickup site, 
interlibrary loan books will be checked out to you before shipment.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How will I know when my article has arrived?</H2>



<P>
You will receive an email notification with instructions to logon to Interlibrary Loan and
Article Delivery. Select Electronically Received Articles to view, download,  or  print  a
PDF copy of your article.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How long will my article be available?</H2>



<P>
Electronically delivered articles will remain available for you  21  days  after  you  are
notified. This means that a document will be removed 21 days after a notification email is
sent to you, not 21 days after you first view the document.
</P>

<P>
If you neglect to retrieve your article within the 21 days, or if you accidentally  delete
an article that you still need, it cannot be reposted-- you will  have  to  submit  a  new
request for that article.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>Is it possible to receive notification at two email addresses?</H2>



<P>
No. You will receive notification from <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U>  at
only one email address, but you can change the email address where notifications are  sent
under Tools / Change User Information at any time.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How long can I keep my interlibrary loan material?</H2>



<P>
The loan period for most interlibrary loan books is four weeks. The lending  library  sets
the loan period, including renewal policies, and may also set special conditions  for  on-
site use, such as "in library use only." The Rutgers University  Libraries  abide  by  all
conditions established by the lending library.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>Can I renew an item?</H2>



<P>
You can renew most interlibrary loan books yourself for one additional 28-day loan  period
in your Library Catalog "MY ACCOUNT" file. The 28-day renewal loan takes effect on the day  you  make
the renewal; 28 days are not added to your original due date unless you wait to  renew  on
that date.
</P>

<P>
You cannot renew interlibrary loan materials that are designated "No Renewal,"  that  have
been recalled by the lending institution, for which the renewal limit has been reached, or
that are not renewed within seven (7) days from the initial due date.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>Can I see my interlibrary loan and article requests under MY ACCOUNT in the Library Catalog?</H2>



<P>
All items obtained for you from another Rutgers  library,  an  E-ZBorrow  library,  or  on
interlibrary loan that you currently have checked out and are responsible for  are  listed
together in your MY ACCOUNT "Review Checkouts" file.
</P>

<P>
You will also find links in MY ACCOUNT to the sites where you can monitor  and  view  your
Library Catalog, ILL, E-ZBorrow, and article requests.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>How long will I see all of my older requests in Finished Requests?</H2>



<P>
We plan to purge older requests annually, so you will see requests for at least one year.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>Whom do I contact if I have problems with or questions about using Interlibrary  Loan  and
Article Delivery Services?</H2>



<P>
Write to <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Ask a Librarian</FONT></U> and interlibrary  loan  staff  will  respond  to  your  question.
Include as much information about your request as you can.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H2>What is ILLiad?</H2>



<P>
ILLiad is the electronic system Rutgers uses to request items  through  interlibrary  loan
and to deliver articles to patrons. It allows you to place requests, track the  status  of
requests, and manage your requests.
