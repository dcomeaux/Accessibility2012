</UL>

 

<P>
The Rutgers University Libraries maintain reserve  collections  and  electronic  access  to  class-related
materials to support the university's academic programs. Books are placed in reserve collections at campus
libraries and circulate for shortened loan periods.  Photocopies  and  documents  such  as  sample  exams,
syllabi, problem sets, readings, lecture notes, and articles are scanned and delivered  electronically  as
Adobe PDF under "RESERVES" in the Library Catalog.
</P>

<P>
The Libraries' policy for reserve services is derived from the fair use guidelines of  the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>United States Copyright Act of 1976</FONT></U> (17 U.S.C. Section 107).
</P>


 

</FONT></U>
<H1>When to Submit Reserve Requests</H1>

<P>
To assure availability of material prior to the start of classes, submit requests for the fall semester by
August 1, spring semester by December 1, and summer sessions by May 1. 
Please indicate on the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Reserve Request Form</FONT></U> 
the week or date an item is needed.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>When Materials Will Be Available on Reserve</H1>

<P>
Lists are processed in the order received. Requests submitted during the first weeks  of  classes  may  be
delayed due to the large volume of reserve processing at the beginning of each semester. At the end of the
term, materials are taken off reserve and permanently deleted from University web servers.
</P>

<P>
Please make  sure  your  materials  are  on  reserve  before  making  assignments.  Search  by  your  name
(instructor's name), course name, or course number under  "RESERVES" in the Library Catalog  to  confirm  reserve
materials are ready for students to check out or view online.
</P>

<P>
Electronic reserve documents can be viewed on campus at public access  workstations  in  the  libraries,  in  campus
computer labs, and PCs connected to the campus network. 
Rutgers users who connect from off-campus to the Libraries' 
website need to log-in with their NetID before using electronic reserves.
</P>

<P>
Please remind your students they will need to  register  their  barcode,  the  14-digit  number  beginning
'29030' on the reverse of their RUconnection card, at a circulation  desk  before
they can check out reserve books in a library.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>What To Place On Reserve</H1>

<P>
The standard loan period for reserve materials checked out in a library is two  hours.  
Contact  local  library  reserve  staff  to
inquire about the availability of extended or overnight loan periods.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Books</EM><BR>
Include Rutgers University call numbers on the "Reserve Request" form. If a book is not available in the Rutgers collections, we will attempt to purchase it in a timely manner. To expedite ordering books, include publisher and date of publication, ISBN, and edition. It may take from two to six weeks or longer to order, receive, and process new books for reserve. 
</P>

<P>
<EM>Electronic Books (e-books) </EM><BR>
Instructors now have an option to request electronic books (e-books) for course reserves. Be sure to select the "e-book acceptable if available" option when filling out a "Reserve Request" Form.  To qualify for course reserves, e-books must be available with unlimited simultaneous users from a vendor with whom the Libraries currently do business.  If the Libraries have a copy of the title in print, an e-book will not be ordered.  E-Books will be processed for reserve following the "Items Available Online in the Library Catalog" guidelines below.  Please note the Libraries do not support Kindles or other e-book readers/devices at this time.
</P>


<P>
<EM>Personal Copies</EM><BR>
We will place personal copies on reserve but cannot be responsible for loss or damage.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Course Packets</EM><BR>
We will place course packets on reserve, provided  permissions  to  reproduce  copyrighted
articles have been obtained for the current semester and are bound in the course packet.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Journal Articles, Chapters in Books</EM><BR>
Make photocopies of  journal  articles  and  chapters  in  books  for
reserve and bring copies directly to the library. Copying should not exceed the limits of  fair  use  (see   &quot;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Copyright Guidelines</FONT></U>&quot;). 
Photocopied  materials  will   be  scanned  and made available electronically as PDF documents. 
</P>

<P>
In order to reproduce your articles in the best possible manner, please submit clear copies with
as few marks on them as possible. This includes copies without highlighting, underlining,  black
lines in the center, and writing in the margins. The better the  quality  of  the  articles  you
submit, the better your students will be served with clear and legible electronic reserves. Poor
quality photocopies will not be scanned.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Electronic Files</EM><BR>
Please supply  documents that you have  prepared  as  electronic  files  in  electronic  form.
Electronic files are the preferred format because they can be processed faster and give  a  better  result
for students. Electronic files result in smaller file sizes that transmit and load faster, the quality  is
much better, and color images can be supplied.
</P>

<P>
Send copies of your electronic files as email attachments (one attachment per email message) to the
library reserve email account provided on your local library's online reserve request form, or drop
off a disk copy at your local reserve desk. 
We  will  not  return  disks after processing unless you ask to have them returned. Include the following information: (1)  your  local
reserve desk library, (2) course name and number, (3) the semester your course will be taught, and (4) the
title of the file and its software application. Electronic files will only be available online.
</P>

<P>
We use Adobe Acrobat Exchange to convert file formats to Portable Document Format  (PDF).  We  accept  the
most popular word processing, spreadsheet, and image formats. We have had successful experience converting
WordPerfect, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Lotus. Other file formats may require trial and  error,  but  we
are willing to work with you.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Items Available Online in the Library Catalog</EM><BR>
If your reserve course list includes  items  which  are  available  online
through the Library Catalog, we will provide the same link that  is  provided  in  the Library Catalog.  
We  will  not  accept
photocopies of electronic materials available  through  the Library Catalog,  or  convert  them  to  PDF  for  electronic
reserves.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Personal Web pages</EM><BR>
We will link to your personal Web page from your course reserve listing in  the Library Catalog.
Web pages will not reside on the Libraries' server. They will be accessible in the Library Catalog only under 
"RESERVES" by searching under instructor's name, course name, and course number. Any passwords you may
have instituted will be in effect once students reach your Web page. Email the title of your page and  its
URL as an item entry on the "Reserve Request Form" you submit to your local library. Links to personal Web
pages are deleted at the end of the semester in which the course is taught.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Media</EM><BR>
Arrangements for media reserve materials on the New  Brunswick  and  Piscataway  campuses  will  be
handled by the Media Center located in the Douglass Library. The main viewing  location is the Media Center on Douglass;  there are smaller viewing facilities (20 students maximum)  in Alexander Library and Kilmer Library.   In  Newark,  contact
Media Services at the Dana Library. In Camden, contact the reserve staff at the Paul  Robeson  Library  to
place media on reserve.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Special Collections</EM><BR>
Special Collections &amp; University Archives are not covered by this policy or the procedures it governs. Instructors are encouraged to consult SC&UA librarians or archivists if they would like to have SC&UA 
materials made available for their courses
</P>


 

</FONT></U>

<H1>How to Link Your Library Reserves to Sakai</H1>

<P>
Your library course reserves can now be linked directly to your Sakai course management page.
</P>

<OL START="1" TYPE="1">
<LI>	The first step is to set up your course reserves with the library.</LI>
</OL>

<OL START="2" TYPE="1">
<LI>	Add the "web content" tool to the menu bar of your Sakai page.</LI>
</OL>

<OL START="3" TYPE="1">
<LI>	Under "customize web content" select the "link to library eReserves" button.
<BR><BR>
An automatic script will run and link to the list of course reserves provided for your  students
in the Library Catalog. The web content tab will automatically be renamed  "Library  eReserves"  for  this  web
link.</LI>
</OL>

<OL START="4" TYPE="1">
<LI>	When your students click on "Library eReserves," the Library Catalog reserve listings will display in  a
window within your Sakai page. Students using library resources will still be working within the
Sakai course page environment.
<BR><BR>
This feature will only work if your course reserves have been processed and  made  available  by
library staff. Due to the nature of the interaction between Sakai and the  library  server,  you
must wait overnight after the establishment of your course reserves in the Library Catalog  before  linking  to
them in Sakai. Students accessing electronic reserves through the Sakai page from a computer  off
campus will be prompted to enter their Net ID when they click on article links.
<BR><BR>
Please keep in mind that reserves are removed at the end  of  each  academic  semester,  so  you
should plan on disabling/removing this feature from your  Sakai  course  page  to  prevent  dead
links. You can reestablish it when course reserves are made available the next time  the  course
is taught. You can direct any questions on this feature to Access Services Reserve staff in  the
libraries or email <U><FONT COLOR=blue>sakai@rutgers.edu</FONT></U> for further help.</LI>

<H1>Copyright Guidelines</H1>

<P>
The Rutgers University Libraries' policy for reserve collections is derived from the fair  use  guidelines
of the United States Copyright Act of 1976. The law states:
</P>

<P>
<EM>Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976. Limitations on Exclusive Rights: Fair Use</EM>
<BR>
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of copyrighted work, including  such
use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by  any  other  means  specified  in  that  section,  for
purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including  multiple  copies  for  classroom
use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the  use  made
of a work in any particular case is fair use the factors to be considered shall include:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>	the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</LI>
<LI>	the nature of the copyrighted work;</LI>
<LI>	the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and</LI>
<LI>	the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if  such  finding  is  made
upon consideration of all the above factors.
</P>

<P>
Materials will be placed on reserve at the request of faculty for the noncommercial,  educational  use  of
students.
</P>

<P>
Photocopied or scanned copies of complete books and entire issues  of  journals  will  not  be  placed  on
reserve.
</P>

<P>
Students and library users will not be charged for access to reserve materials. The charge for copies made
by students will be limited to the cost of reproduction.
</P>

<P>
Electronic copies of reserve readings will include a notice of  copyright  on  the  first  screen
indicating materials may be covered by copyright.
</P>

<P>
Electronic reserve materials will be accessible only by instructor's name, course name, and course number.
Users connecting from off-campus to the Libraries  website  using  a  commercial  internet  provider  must
identify themselves as a Rutgers user by logging-in with their NetID before they can access reserve materials.
</P>

<P>
Electronic materials will be removed from reserve at the end of the term. Scanned copies will be destroyed
when they are no longer used for reserve.
</P>

<P>
We will not place materials, including electronic files or web pages, on reserve if the nature, scope,  or
extent of copying is judged to exceed limits of fair use.
</P>

<P>
In some cases, placing photocopied or scanned material on reserve may require copyright permission. Use of
the same photocopied or scanned material in multiple  courses  or  for  successive  years  will  generally
require permission. Faculty may wish to consider the following options:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>	The Rutgers University Bookstore will obtain copyright approval and pay royalties  for  materials  in
course  packs  ordered  by  Rutgers  faculty.  Contact  the  bookstore  at  732-246-8448  for   additional
information.</LI>

<LI>	The Copyright Clearance Center (CCC) offers an Academic Permission  Service  (APS)  and  will  secure
copyright permissions  for  faculty  course  packs  or  course  handouts  for  a  fee.  Visit  CCC  Online
