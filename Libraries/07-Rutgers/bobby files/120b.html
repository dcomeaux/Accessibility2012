FAQ: Remote Access to Library Resources


<P>
<EM>NOTE:</EM>  
If you were attempting to use electronic resources (electronic reserves; indexes or databases; electronic
journals, etc.) and were redirected to this page, that generally means that you are not being  recognized

   </UL>
</LI>
</UL>

 

</FONT></U>

<H1>Who can use the Libraries' electronic indexes and full-text resources?</H1>

<P>
By contract, remote access to the Rutgers University Library's indexes and  other  electronic
resources is available only to current Rutgers students, faculty and staff.  Faculty  emeriti
and visiting scholars at the university are recognized as current faculty.
</P>

<P>
Current students and faculty  in  certain  Rutgers/UMDNJ  joint  degree  programs--namely,  the
Rutgers/UMDNJ Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) and School of Public  Health  (SPH)
on the New Brunswick and Piscataway campuses--may also qualify for access. Others  are  welcome
to use our resources on-site in any Rutgers library. Or check out the list of
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Public Access Databases</FONT></U>.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Do I need a password to use the Library Catalog or the indexes to articles and other publications?</H1>

<P>
Access to the Library Catalog is unrestricted.
</P>

<P>
Nor are passwords required for the use of individual online indexes or other electronic publications. However, you will need to login with 
your <EM>Rutgers University NetID</EM> in order to access these online library resources from off-campus. 
</P>

<P>
If you have a Rutgers NetID and do not remember what it is you may look it up using the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>
NetID Lookup application</FONT></U>. If you do not yet have a Rutgers NetID you may 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Create a OIT Account and NetID</FONT></U>.
 </P>

<P>
Students and faculty in recognized Rutgers/UMDNJ joint programs (Rutgers/UMDNJ Graduate School of Biomedical
Sciences (GSBS) and School of Public Health (SPH) on the New Brunswick and Piscataway campuses) may login with a <EM>Rutgers University Libraries' 
barcode and PIN</EM>.  To receive a barcode and PIN, joint program participants must register <EM>in-person</EM> 
at either the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Alexander Library</FONT></U> or
 the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library of Science and Medicine</FONT></U> 
Circulation Desks. 
 Faculty emeriti and visiting scholars may also login in with a library barcode and PIN.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>How do I connect to the Libraries' electronic resources from home?</H1>

<P>
There are several options:
</P>


<UL>
<LI>
If you normally connect to the web via a commercial Internet Services Provider (e.g.,  AOL,  NetZero,
etc.), you can use the Libraries' electronic resources remotely  by  logging  in  with  your  Rutgers
University NetID.
</LI>
</UL>


<P>
From a Rutgers Libraries' page, just click on the 
<EM>LOGIN HERE</EM> 
link on the upper left.
</P>

<!-- these images also linked by refwroks page -->
[INLINE]

<P>
Then enter your NetID and Password into the Login box.
</P> 

[INLINE]

<P>
Once you identify yourself as an authorized Rutgers' user, you will  be  able  to  use  most  of  the
Libraries' restricted resources from home.
</P>

<P>
If you have a Rutgers NetID and do not remember what it is you may look it up using the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>NetID Lookup application</FONT></U>. If you do not yet have a Rutgers NetID you may 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Create a OIT Account and NetID</FONT></U>.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H1>I've already configured my browser and am connecting using my Library Barcode and 
PIN.  Do I need to change to a NetID login?</H1> 

<P>
If you have already configured your browser to access restricted library resources 
remotely don't worry, the "old" method will continue to work until August 22nd 2005.
</P>

 
<!--

<h1>I have my browser configured to connect with my Library Barcode and PIN.  How do I switch to NetID login?</h1>

<p class="flush">
If you would like to switch to the new login you will need to "unconfigure" your browser by removing the old proxy setup. Since we will be running both proxy 
services until August 22<sup>nd</sup> (2005) the easiest way to do this is to leave the Automatic Configuration URL in place, but deselect the choice.
</p>

<p class="flush">
To do this: 
</p>


<div class="indent25">
<p class="flush">
In <strong>Netscape</strong> choose:<br />

 <strong>EDIT</strong> &gt; <strong>PREFERENCES</strong> &gt; <strong>ADVANCED</strong> &gt; <strong>PROXIES</strong>
<br /> 
then Click on the "<strong>Direct connection to the Internet</strong>" radio button 
</p>


<p class="flush">
In <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> choose:<br />
 <strong>TOOLS</strong> &gt; <strong>INTERNET OPTIONS</strong> &gt; <strong>CONNECTIONS</strong> &gt; <strong>LAN SETTINGS</strong>
<br />

 <strong>Uncheck</strong> the Automatic Configuration URL check box. 
<br />
(also do it for any DialUp Settings you have it entered in)

<H1>I tried to login with my NetID, but it's just giving me some sort of message about cookies.</H1>

<P>
You see this message when your browser is set not to accept cookies.
</P>

<P>
In order for the proxy server to keep track of users that have already logged in, it will send a cookie
to your browser that you will need to accept. This is a session based cookie only and does not  in  any
way store any information about sites you have visited.
</P>

<P>
If you have disabled cookies on your browser, you will need to change this setting in order to use 
the NetID login..

<H1>After I put in my NetID, a box comes up telling me I'm being redirected to a nonsecure
site, and that anything I input can be read by others.  Why is this happening?</H1>

<P>
The login to the Rutgers web site is a secure channel.  When the login in is
complete, it passes you to the regular library page, which is not a secure
site.  The security certificate that you have to accept is your agreement to
go from the secure login site to the Libraries' web page. So don't worry,
your login information is safe.  You only get the certificate AFTER you have successfully logged in.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>I logged in with my NetID, but when I use my bookmark to go to ScienceDirect it won't let me look at any articles.</H1>

<P>
By using a bookmark that you set up before you started using the NetID login, even though you're still logged in you've become "disassociated"  from the proxy server.</P>

<P>
Doing any of the following during a session can cause the proxy server to assume that you're no longer connected:</P>

<UL><LI>Using a bookmark that was set up before you started using the NetID login.</LI>
<LI>Using a article link that you emailed to yourself from a campus computer.</LI>
<LI>Clicking on home.</LI>
<LI>Typing a url into the location bar that doesn?t include the proxy, ie., "proxy.libraries.rutgers.edu".</LI>
<LI> Attempting to connect to a restricted resource from a non-RUL page.</LI>
</UL>

<P>To reconnect to the proxy server, just go back to a Rutgers Libraries page and
click on the yellow "LOGIN HERE" link. This should immediately change to "Logged In."  Then select ScienceDirect (or any other resource that you're trying to access) directly from the Libraries' web page.
</P>

<P>
Once you've connected from the Libraries' page, you can bookmark the new 'proxied' address.
</P>

<P>
As long as "proxy.libraries.rutgers.edu" appears before the first single slash in a web address, you are logged in and are 
being recognized as an authorized Rutgers user.</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>I have my browser configured to connect with my Library Barcode, but I've forgotten my Password.</H1>

<P>
Your Password is your <EM>library  PIN</EM>:  A  four-digit  personal  identification
number issued by the Libraries. If you do not have or have forgotten your PIN, 
go to or <U><FONT COLOR=blue>call</FONT></U> the Circulation Desk 
of any Rutgers Library, or else fill out 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library PIN/Registration form</FONT></U>.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>I'm a student in a Rutgers/UMDNJ joint degree program, a faculty emeriti, or a visiting scholar.. How do I connect?</H1>

<P>
Students and faculty in recognized Rutgers/UMDNJ joint degree programs who are not qualified to
obtain a Rutgers NetID, faculty emeriti, and visiting scholars may login with a Rutgers  University  Libraries'  barcode  and  PIN.  To
receive a barcode and PIN, joint degree program participants must register in-person at  either
the    <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Alexander
Library</FONT></U> or
 the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library of Science and Medicine</FONT></U> 
Circulation Desks. 
Visiting scholars must register in-person at any Rutgers library and present a valid RUconnection ID card.  
Faculty emeriti may register in-person or by filling out a 
"<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Registering with the Libraries</FONT></U>" online form.
</P>


<P>
Once you have registered and received a Rutgers Libraries barcode and PIN, from a Rutgers Libraries' page just click on the
<EM>LOGIN HERE</EM>
link on the upper left.
</P>

[INLINE]

<P>
Click on the "Library barcode and PIN Login" link in the lower right of the next page.</P>

[INLINE] 

<P>
Enter your 14-digit library barcode and 4-digit library PIN.</P>

[INLINE]

<P>
Once you accept the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>security certificate</FONT></U> you will be returned to the page that you entered from; your <EM>LOGGED IN</EM> status will now be indicated on the upper left.</P>

</FONT></U>
<H1>I'm trying to login with my Rutgers Libraries Barcode and PIN, but they're not being recognized.</H1>

<P>
There may be a number of reasons why your Barcode/PIN are not being recognized. 
</P>

<UL>
<LI>How recently were you issued your barcode and/or PIN?</LI>
</UL>


    <P>
    If your barcode and/or PIN were only issued today, they are not yet available for remote access. Newly-issued barcodes/PINs will not be recognized by the proxy server until the following day. 
They will however, work immediately in your Library Catalog   
"<U><FONT COLOR=blue>MY ACCOUNT</FONT></U>".  
Try the numbers there to make sure that you're using the correct numbers. 
    </P>


<UL>
<LI>
Have you previously gone to 
"<U><FONT COLOR=blue>MY ACCOUNT</FONT></U>"
and changed your PIN to a combination of letters and numbers, or just letters? 
</LI>
</UL>


<P>
If there are alpha characters in your password, 
<EM>they must be capitalized even if they were originally entered as lowercase.</EM>

library databases remotely all semester, but tonight when I try to
connect to PsycINFO I'm being asked for an ID and Password.</H1>

<P>
If you are able to access other restricted Rutgers
Libraries resources but are being asked to login when you try to connect
to a specific database such as PsycINFO or Factiva, most likely you are
trying to use that database at a time when the number of simultaneous
users that Rutgers has contracted for has already been reached.
</P>

<P>
In which case all you need to do is to try again a little later.
</P>

<H1>I live right on campus and my dorm is wired so I can connect to the Rutgers network.  
But when I tried to use some electronic journals today it wouldn't let me in.  What's the problem?</H1>

<P>
Unfortunately, due to the way the local networks were set up there are sometimes connectivity problems to library resources
for students living in the Rutgers apartments. 
</P>

<P>
If you have followed the instructions at the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Rutgers Residential Networking</FONT></U> site and properly registered your on-campus computer, and find that you are 
not able to access certain library resources, please write to 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Ask a Librarian</FONT></U> and tell us which specific title you were unable to 
access and where you were trying to access it from.
</P>
 
<P>
Until the problem is resolved, you should still be able to access restricted library resources by logging in with your Rutgers NetID.  See the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Remote Access Instructions</FONT></U>.

<H1>I am trying to get an article from a 1989 issue of "The Journal of
Physics and Chemistry of Solids", which is a Science Direct title.  I get a
message saying that this isn't part of our libraries regular subscription
but I can still get it by clicking again.  In the past I have done this
and have always received the article.  Now a message comes up and says
"Either your account is not configured to allow this transaction, or the
transactional balance limits have been exceeded."</H1>

<P>
Prior to January 2003 Elsevier, the provider of Science Direct, allowed
access to pre-1995 issues of journals that Rutgers' subscribes to as well
as access to certain journals that Rutgers does not subscribe to in print
on a "transactional allowance" basis.  As of January 2003, this allowance
was eliminated in favor of a "per access" charge that would cost Rutgers
an estimated $220,000 this year over the $1.1 million that we are already
paying annually for our Science Direct subscription--a pricing structure
that we find neither reasonable nor within our budgetary means to support.
</P>

<P>
The Rutgers Libraries have all the pre-1995 issues of many of the Elsevier
titles in print format; please 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>check the Library Catalog to see which libraries hold the physical copies</FONT></U>.  
Articles not available in any Rutgers library may be requested via 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan</FONT></U>.
</P>

<H1>When I'm done using the library resources, how do I log out?</H1>

<P>
If you're logged on from home or some other location where you are the only one using that particular computer, there is no 
real need to log out.  You will automatically be logged out when you close your browser; or if you move on to doing other things 
the login connection will time out after about two hours.</P>

<P>If however you are logging in from a public site--another library, an internet cafe, a workplace PC that you share with others--you 
should close your browser and break the connection when you're done.</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>I'm no longer a student at Rutgers, but my computer is still asking for my Rutgers Username and Password.  How do I turn this off?</H1>

<P>
You need to "unconfigure" your <!-- Netscape or Internet Explorer  -->browser by removing the old proxy setup. The easiest 
way to do this is to leave the Automatic Configuration URL in place, but deselect the choice.
</P>

<P>
To do this: 
</P>

<!-- <ul>
In <strong>Netscape</strong> choose:<br />
 <strong>EDIT</strong> &gt; <strong>PREFERENCES</strong> &gt; <strong>ADVANCED</strong> &gt; <strong>PROXIES</strong>

<br /> 
then Click on the "<strong>Direct connection to the Internet</strong>" radio button 
</ul> -->

<UL>
<BR>
In <EM>Internet Explorer</EM> choose:<BR>
 <EM>TOOLS</EM> &gt; <EM>INTERNET OPTIONS</EM> &gt; <EM>CONNECTIONS</EM> &gt; <EM>LAN SETTINGS</EM>

<BR>
 <EM>Uncheck</EM> the Automatic Configuration URL check box. 
<BR>
(also do it for any DialUp Settings you have it entered in) 
</UL>
