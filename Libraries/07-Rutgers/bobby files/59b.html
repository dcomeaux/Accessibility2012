<P> The Rutgers University  Libraries  maintain  memberships  in  consortia  and  have
special cooperative and affiliated arrangements with libraries and other  organizations  to  provide
access to scholarly materials for Rutgers faculty, students, and staff. Current partners are the RLG
Partnership,  the  OCLC  Research  Libraries  Advisory  Committee,  the  Virtual  Academic   Library
Environment of New Jersey (VALE), and Council of Two-year College Libraries,  the  Metropolitan  New
York Library Council (METRO), the Pennsylvania Academic Library Consortia, Inc.  (PALCI),  Princeton
University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry  of  New  Jersey  (UMDNJ),  the  New  Brunswick
Theological Seminary, the American Hungarian Foundation, the  Whitman  Library,  and  various  local
arrangements. The terms of each agreement vary.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>RLG Partnership SHARES Program</H1>

<P>
SHARES began as a collaborative effort of RLG over 20 years. It enables participating institutions to agree on prices, procedures and policies; monitor their own performance; and manage workflow to support increased lending activities.  The program gives each participant's faculty, students and staff on-site access to collections and services at the other SHARES institutions. This international sharing partnership expands and enhances local collections with materials owned by partners around the world.
</P>

<P>
On-site access
</P>

<P>
On-site access privileges through the SHARES partnership permit faculty, emeritus faculty, students, and academic and professional library staff of partners' institutions to use the collections and services at other SHARES libraries.  Rutgers visitors at other SHARES libraries must present a currently valid RUconnection photo ID card.
</P>

<P>
In-library use of material is permitted, but visitors are not granted borrowing privileges. When libraries have restricted stack access, visitors will receive the same degree of access accorded their peers at the host institution; for example, visiting faculty will be accorded local faculty stack privileges. Access to special or restricted collections or materials is possible if arranged in advance.
</P>

<P>
On-site access does not extend to alumni, retired faculty (except for emeritus faculty), courtesy or fee borrowers, spouses, or docents; or to faculty, staff, and students from non-SHARES units affiliated with SHARES participants.
</P>

<P>
Local protocols take precedence over the SHARES on-site access guidelines. For example, participating institutions in the same region may have established more liberal policies or more specific guidelines for each other's clientele.  Visitors can expect reference consultation, photocopying at the local constituency rate, database search services at the local constituency rate, and other services available to comparable groups at the host institution.
</P>

<P>
Special arrangements may be available for using unique local resources and electronic databases that are restricted by license agreements. Visitors will not receive direct ILL borrowing services; for example, the visitor cannot present an ALA ILL Request form and expect to carry out the requested item.
</P>

<P>
On-site access is available during the institution's regular business hours. To verify hours, holiday access, and access to departmental libraries and special collections, contact the SHARES partner contact in advance:  
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/shares/partners/default.htm</FONT></U>
</P>


<P>
Consult the website for policy details:  
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/shares/procedures.htm </FONT></U>.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>OCLC RLAC Reciprocal Faculty Borrowing Program</H1>

<P>
The OCLC Research Libraries Advisory Committee sponsors a Reciprocal Faculty Borrowing Program that allows borrowing privileges and on-site access to faculty members of participating institutions. A current list of participants is available at:  
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>http://www.oclc.org/membership/advisorycommittees/profile8.htm</FONT></U>.
</P>

<P>
When Rutgers faculty wish to use a participating institution, Rutgers librarians may search the institution's library web site for the policies of the institution of interest. Interlibrary loan staff may also search OCLC's Policies Directory for relevant access policies.  Refer Rutgers faculty to the head, university libraries access and interlibrary services, who will issue an OCLC/RLAC card for an appropriate period.
</P>

<P>
Refer faculty from an OCLC institutions who present an RLAC/OCLC card at a circulation or reference desk to the head, university libraries access and interlibrary services who will issue a Guest borrowers card for the appropriate period.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>New Jersey Library Network and Statewide Library Services</H1>

<P>
The Rutgers University Libraries participate in programs of the New Jersey State Library that provide interlibrary loan services to New Jersey public, academic, school, and special libraries through the statewide New Jersey Library Network. Rutgers libraries also participate in activities and services of appropriate regional library cooperatives.
</P>

<P>
Interlibrary Loan Services - The Rutgers University Libraries provide interlibrary loan and photocopy of materials held in the Rutgers Libraries' collections to libraries that participate in the New Jersey Library Network.
</P>

<P>

</P>


 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO)</H1>

<P>
The Rutgers University Libraries participate in the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO), a nonprofit membership organization of more than 250 libraries and library systems located primarily in the five boroughs of New York City, and Westchester County.  METRO members represent a diverse group of individual libraries include academic, hospital, law, business and other types of special libraries, research libraries, public library systems, school library systems, archival collections and others in the information field across the metropolitan area.  In key areas including resource sharing, digitization, advocacy, professional development, job placement, collection expansion, and shared services, METRO helps libraries of all kinds to protect and expand their role as vital resources for learning.
</P>

<P>
The Rutgers University Libraries participate in the METRO Referral Cards program, which gives users limited access to collections that are usually closed to the public. Cards for Rutgers library users are issued from the reference desks of any Rutgers library, and cards brought to Rutgers by users from other METRO libraries are honored at any Rutgers circulation desk. 
</P>

<P>
Yellow cards are used for access to specific titles, while blue cards provide access to specific subject collections. Instructions are available on <U><FONT COLOR=blue>METRO's website</FONT></U> by following the path Programs and Services / Delivery Services / Referral Cards/.
</P>

<P>
RLG SHARES libraries that are also METRO members recognize Rutger's RLG status for onsite access; Rutgers visitors are not required to produce METRO reference cards.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Pennsylvania Academic Library Consortium, Inc. (PALCI)</H1>


<P>
The Rutgers University Libraries joined the Pennsylvania Academic Library Consortium, Inc. (PALCI) in 2003. PALCI is a membership organization formed in 1996 as a grassroots federation of private and public academic libraries. The primary mission of the group is to spur the development of library cooperation within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and now beyond to other nearby states, and its focus has been the improvement of virtual library services among member institutions.
</P>

<P>
<EM>E-ZBorrow</EM> - Over three dozen academic libraries, including Rutgers, currently participate in the PALCI E-ZBorrow program. PALCI libraries have developed a virtual union catalog with more than twenty-six million items that permits combined searching and direct requesting by their students, faculty, and staff.
</P>

<P>
E-ZBorrow works as an extension of Rutgers collections. It may be used for requesting books either not owned, checked out, or otherwise not available in the Rutgers University Libraries. Requests may be placed for books charged out to or on hold for another Rutgers borrower, available only as a reference or reserve item at Rutgers, or noted as missing in the Library Catalog. Books are normally available in seven or fewer working days.
</P>

<P>
E-ZBorrow books are charged out in the Library Catalog in the same way as books owned at Rutgers. Requesters are notified by email when a request has been placed and when books are ready for pick up. They are also be notified about book availability in their MY ACCOUNT in the Library Catalog.
</P>

<P>
Users will find links to the E-ZBorrow program on the Libraries' website in a number of locations. More information on the E-ZBorrow program is available on the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Delivery and Interlibrary Loan</FONT></U> page.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Reciprocal Borrowing</EM> - TThrough PALCI, Rutgers also participates in a free reciprocal borrowing program that grants faculty direct, personal access to materials that are not available at the home institution. A list of participating libraries is available  <U><FONT COLOR=blue>here</FONT></U>.
Rutgers faculty wishing to take advantage of this service must secure an authorization form from the circulation desk of any Rutgers library. The form must be signed by the head of access services on the particular campus. Faculty from other PALCI libraries who present an authorization form at a Rutgers circulation desk are registered as guest borrowers with one-year expiration.  Copies of all forms are sent to the head, university libraries access and interlibrary services, Alexander Library.
</P>

<P>
Additional information is available on the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>PALCI website</FONT></U>.

<H1>New Brunswick Theological Seminary (Sage Library)</H1>

<P>
Gardner A. Sage Library of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary and the Rutgers University Libraries have a long tradition of cooperation. Sage and Rutgers library collections have traditionally been understood to complement each other since they reflect each institution's overall mission and scope of research and study. In practice, this has meant over the years that the Rutgers libraries relied on Sage Library for many theological and religious works. The Rutgers collections now also have a strong foundation of theological and religious works, while Sage Library has expanded its scope to include strengths in such areas as the African- American religious experience, urban ministry, and Asian immigrant materials.
</P>

<P>
Faculty and students of the seminary and the university are welcome to use Sage and Rutgers libraries according to the following arrangements:
</P>

<P>
<EM>Seminary Users at Rutgers</EM> - Full-time faculty, adjunct professors during the semester they are teaching, students, and staff are eligible for primary borrowing privileges at the Rutgers University Libraries. Privileges are issued for one year with expiration dates of 6/30 or 12/31, and must be renewed annually. As primary borrowers, Seminary users receive term loans and may request delivery of Rutgers books to a Rutgers pickup library and electronic delivery of Rutgers articles.  Seminary faculty may request Alexander Library to place materials on reserve for their classes.  The Sage Library provides interlibrary loan services to Seminary faculty, staff, and students. To register at RUL, Seminary students must bring a letter of validation from the seminary and an ID card to the circulation desk of any Rutgers library. Full-time faculty, adjunct professors, and staff whose names appear on the list provided annually by Sage Library to the Rutgers university libraries administration are entered into the Rutgers online borrower file; they may present an ID card at any Rutgers circulation desk to receive a borrower card. 
</P>

<P>
<EM>Rutgers Users at Sage</EM> - Rutgers full-time faculty and graduate students may register for direct borrowing privileges at Sage Library upon presentation of a current Rutgers identification card. Undergraduates must present a completed  
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>form letter</FONT></U> [PDF] from a Rutgers reference librarian and signed by a circulation supervisor, or a letter from a professor, indicating that they need Sage resources. Sage library staff may telephone the circulation desk at Alexander Library to verify a student or faculty member's current status and Rutgers affiliation. Sage Library sets borrowing terms and privileges. Rutgers faculty and graduate students are permitted to borrow up to 25 items at one time, while undergraduates are permitted to borrow up to 6 items. Materials borrowed on site at Sage need to be returned directly to Sage Library. Rutgers borrowers with long overdue items borrowed from the Sage Library are subject to Rutgers University Libraries' lost item replacement fees and delinquent accounts procedures, including transcripts and diploma holds at Rutgers and collection agency fees. Faculty, students and staff on any Rutgers campus can request Sage Library items by using 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U>. Materials will be borrowed from Sage or another resource sharing partner by the interlibrary loan services staff. Rutgers faculty may request Sage Library to place materials on reserve for their classes, and students on their class rosters are entitled to temporary borrower privileges.
