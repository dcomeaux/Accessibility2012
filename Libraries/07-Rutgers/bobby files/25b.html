</UL>

 

<P>
The reference and information service program of the Rutgers University  Libraries  is  designed  to
support the  instructional,  research,  and  service  missions  of  the  university.  The  following
guidelines are used to describe and implement the various service programs provided in each library.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Service Definitions</H1>

<P>
<EM>Information Service</EM> - Basic/general information  can  be  provided  by  librarians,
staff, or trained student assistants - in  person,  by  telephone,  and  by  email  either  sent  to
individual librarians or staff or received through Ask a Librarian. Information can also be conveyed
through signage, through printed or online finding aids and guides, and such electronic resources as
the Library Catalog, online indexes and other basic reference tools, and  the  Libraries'  Web  pages.  Information
services addresses the more routine information needs of patrons, including:
</P>

<UL>
<LI> Library holdings and bibliographic citations</LI>
<LI> Library policies (e.g., Admission to the libraries, borrowing, interlibrary loan)</LI>
<LI> Library hours/directions</LI>
<LI> Ready reference (e.g., Brief definitions, brief statistical data, other concise factual information)</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<EM>Reference Service</EM> - Reference service  is  provided  by  all  the  Rutgers  libraries.  Professional
librarians provide the most in-depth service; highly trained staff or graduate assistants under  the
supervision of professional librarians may provide other levels of service.  Reference  service  may
take place at the reference desk, in private consultations with reference specialists, by telephone,
by correspondence, by email either to individual librarians or staff or through Ask a Librarian,  or
by instant messaging, text messaging, or other information delivery options.
</P>

<P>
Reference librarians are also involved in the development and implementation of printed  and  online
finding aids and research guides, the selection and implementation of automated  reference  systems,
services, and user interfaces designed to support independent research and end-user searching.
</P>

<P>
Since the Rutgers University Libraries are part of an educational institution, reference service  is
often appropriately instructional in nature, fostering the user's  information  literacy  and  self-
sufficiency by instruction in the methods of research, the  tools  of  research  (both  printed  and
electronic), and the ability to  evaluate  the  quality  and  relevance  of  the  research  material
retrieved. Reference Service includes instruction in the use of bibliographic sources, assistance in
developing research strategies, assistance in locating complex data, the retrieval of  data  through
electronic means, etc.
</P>

<P>
At other times, especially in the smaller and more specialized of the Rutgers Libraries, or in cases
involving users with special needs, reference service might more  appropriately  take  the  form  of
providing factual answers or retrieving and packaging bibliographic or  statistical  data.  In  many
instances, reference assistance involves  the  use  of  electronic  resources  available  on  either
networked or standalone workstations.
</P>

<P>
The mission of the library, the needs of the user, and the professional judgment  of  the  reference
librarian will usually determine the appropriate level of service.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Whom We Serve, and Why</H1>

<P>
The primary community served by the  Rutgers  University  Libraries  consists  of  current  faculty,
faculty emeritus, students, staff, and administrators of Rutgers University.
</P>

<P>
The Libraries' reference and information services are available  to  all  individuals  on  site,  by
telephone, by correspondence, and through online services including Ask a Librarian (email),  Ask  a
Librarian Live (Instant Messaging), text messaging, and other electronic forums as available.
</P>

<P>
The Libraries may engage in mutually beneficial contractual  arrangements.  These  include  referral
services for the New Jersey Library Network, METRO  libraries,  OCLC,  and  the  Research  Libraries
Group. These reciprocal arrangements provide the needed services for Rutgers users who  cannot  have
their needs met within the Rutgers  libraries.  The  Libraries  also  provide  services  to  certain
university affiliates. See <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Public Services Policy Memo 6: Cooperative
Arrangements</FONT></U>, for details.
</P>

<P>
Reference service provided by a Rutgers library as a professional courtesy to outside  users  (other
librarians, independent researchers, etc.) does not take the place of  services  provided  by  their
primary library - whether school, public, academic, or  special.  In  many  instances,  it  will  be
appropriate to ascertain that outside users have already exhausted the resources of those libraries,
or to refer such users  to  other  appropriate  libraries,  especially  when  we  do  not  have  the
specialized resources needed or the professional expertise to handle their queries.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Service Limitations</H1>

<P>
<EM>Electronic Service</EM> - This service,  email  or  text  messages  sent  to  individual
librarians or staff, queries received through Ask  a  Librarian,  or  queries  submitted  to  Ask  a
Librarian LIVE, is intended primarily for the faculty, students, and staff of Rutgers University. We
will answer  inquiries  from  non-affiliated  users  concerning  the  university,  the  collections,
resources, and services of the Libraries or relating in some way  to  New  Jersey.  Other  kinds  of
questions from non-primary users will be  dealt  with  as  time  and  staff  permit.  For  questions
submitted to the email Ask a Librarian service a response will usually be  sent  within  twenty-four
hours, except on weekends and holidays.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Telephone Service</EM> - Information or reference assistance  given  by  telephone  will
generally be quite brief. Users in need of more extensive assistance may be  advised  to  visit  the
library or referred to a subject specialist.
</P>

<P>
More extensive telephone service will be provided to other Rutgers  Libraries,  other  institutions,
and, when possible, to Rutgers faculty and students. In most such instances,  these  users  will  be
advised that librarians will call back with the desired information, as instant responses  will  not
normally be feasible.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Licensing</EM> - There  will  be  instances  in  which  licensing  agreements  or  other
contractual restrictions preclude offering the same level of service to non-Rutgers users.  In  such
instances, appropriate reference service might consist of a referral to a library able  and  willing
to provide the desired service.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Legal, Medical, or Pharmaceutical Advice</EM> -  The  Libraries  cannot  provide  legal,
medical, or pharmaceutical advice in response to reference queries. Specific information may be read
from manuals, but in most circumstances users will be referred to sources of information from  which
to draw conclusions.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Commercial  Products  and/or  Services</EM>   -   The   Libraries   will   not   provide
recommendations on commercial products and/or services in response to queries but will  refer  users
to sources of information on these topics.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Liability</EM> - The  Libraries  assume  no  liability  for  any  misinformation  and/or
interpretations drawn from sources cited in response to queries.
</P>


 

</FONT></U>
<H1>How Service is Provided</H1>

<P>
<EM>Code of Ethics</EM> - All information transactions between library staff and users, regardless of whether
they take place at a formal service point or  in  some  other  context,  will  be  governed  by  the
standards articulated in the American Library Association's Code of Ethics. A copy of  the  Code  is
attached as <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Appendix 1</FONT></U>.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Equity  of  Service</EM>  -  Library  staff  will  provide  information  service  to  all  users  without
discrimination based on race, creed, gender, sexual preference, disability, age, ethnicity,  English
language proficiency, or Rutgers affiliation.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Professional Conduct</EM> - All information transactions will be conducted  with  professional  courtesy,
respect, and confidentiality.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Instruction and Referral</EM> - Librarians  will  attempt  to  provide  complete,  accurate,  and  timely
information in response to all questions. In many cases, however, an "answer" will take the form  of
instruction in the use of research materials. In other cases, because of the scope  of  the  Rutgers
collections or because of a user's primary affiliation with another institution, an  "answer"  might
take the form of a specific referral to another institution.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Reference Interviews</EM> - Librarians will conduct reference interviews using the most effective  proven
techniques, including open-ended, neutral questioning. Library staff will refrain from making  overt
judgments about the merit, relevance, or value of questions posed by users.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Librarian Competencies</EM> - All librarians providing reference service will attempt to  adhere  to  the
highest standards of knowledge and proficiency. All public service librarians must have knowledge of
the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI> The reference  resources available at Rutgers</LI>
<LI> Library collection scope (local and systemwide)</LI>
<LI> the Library Catalog and other networked electronic resources</LI>
<LI> Major bibliographic networks Libraries' website</LI>
<LI> Local services and expertise and where to refer effectively within the Libraries systemwide</LI>
<LI> Regional and national resources, especially in their areas of expertise</LI>
<LI> Library and university policies</LI>
<LI> Newly emerging technologies</LI>
<LI> <EM>Development and Training</EM> - Professional development is the ongoing responsibility of all librarians to maintain current skills, develop new skills, and to implement the information services needed in a constantly changing environment. To support this development the Rutgers University Libraries will provide in-service training for librarians, encourage and support attendance at other professional programs, and provide the appropriate equipment suitable for service at the highest level.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The Libraries will continue to provide, on a systemwide basis, workshops and other  formal  programs
designed to help librarians keep abreast of new technologies and  other  advances  and  to  maintain
traditional skills at a high level. Such programs should include both in-house and external experts.
</P>

<P>
Individual units will continue to provide local workshops and programs  targeted  to  the  needs  of
local librarians and their immediate constituencies.
</P>

<P>
All libraries will continue to foster an atmosphere of cordiality and collegiality  that  encourages
colleagues to share their expertise with one another on a formal and informal basis.
</P>

<P>
Participation in formal and informal educational programs is recognized as a key part  of  scholarly
development.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Recruitment</EM> - In every  recruitment  process  for  public  services  positions,  the  Libraries  are
committed to seeking a candidate with the requisite expertise and  a  commitment  to  reference  and
information services.

</FONT></U>
<H2>Appendix 1</H2>

<P>
<EM>Code of Ethics of the American Library Association</EM>
</P>

<P>
As members of the American Library Association, we recognize the importance of codifying and  making
known to the profession and to the general public the ethical principles  that  guide  the  work  of
librarians, other professionals providing information services, library trustees and library staffs.
</P>

<P>
Ethical dilemmas occur when values are in conflict. The American Library Association Code of  Ethics
states the values to which we are committed,  and  embodies  the  ethical  responsibilities  of  the
profession in this changing information environment.
</P>

<P>
We significantly influence or control the selection, organization, preservation,  and  dissemination
of information. In a political system grounded in  an  informed  citizenry,  we  are  members  of  a
profession explicitly committed to intellectual freedom and the freedom of access to information. We
have a special obligation to ensure the free flow of information and ideas  to  present  and  future
generations.
</P>

<P>
The principles of this Code are expressed in broad statements  to  guide  ethical  decision  making.
These statements provide a framework; they cannot and do not dictate  conduct  to  cover  particular
situations.
</P>

<OL TYPE="I">
<LI> We provide the highest level of service to all library users through appropriate and usefully organized resources; equitable service policies; equitable access; and accurate, unbiased, and courteous responses to all requests.</LI>
<LI> We uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist all efforts to censor library resources.</LI>
<LI> We protect each library user's right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted. </LI>
<LI> We respect intellectual property rights and advocate balance between the interests of information users and rights holders. </LI>
<LI> We treat co-workers and other colleagues with respect, fairness, and good faith, and advocate conditions of employment that safeguard the rights and welfare of all employees of our institutions. </LI>
<LI> We do not advance private interests at the expense of library users, colleagues, or our employing institutions. </LI>
<LI> We distinguish between our personal convictions and professional duties and do not allow our personal beliefs to interfere with fair representation of the aims of our institutions or the provision of access to their information resources. </LI>
<LI> We strive for excellence in the profession by maintaining and enhancing our own knowledge and skills, by encouraging the professional development of co-workers, and by fostering the aspirations of potential members of the profession. </LI>
