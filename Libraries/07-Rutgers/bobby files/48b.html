</UL>

 

<P> 
Rutgers University, founded in 1766, is the eighth oldest institution  of  higher  learning  in  the
United States. As Rutgers has evolved into a major research university, the library system has  also
grown into one of the top academic research libraries in the country. Expanding from one library  to
more than twenty separate libraries, collections, and reading rooms,  located  on  campuses  in  New
Brunswick/Piscataway, Camden, and Newark, the libraries at Rutgers serve over  three  million  users
each year. The Rutgers Digital Library includes the Rutgers Community Repository (RUcore) and  other
networked resources.
</P>

<P> 
The Rutgers University Libraries ascribe to  the  <EM>Library  Bill  of  Rights</EM>,  the  <EM>Freedom  to  Read
Statement</EM>, and the <EM>Freedom to View Statement</EM> developed by the American Library Association  as  well
as the <EM>Intellectual Freedom Principles for  Academic  Libraries</EM>  developed  by  the  Association  of
College and Research Libraries, a division of the American Library Association. These documents  are
appended to this policy memo.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Mission</H1>

<P> 
The Rutgers University Libraries support and enrich the instructional, research, and public service missions of the University through the stewardship of scholarly information and the delivery of information services. 
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Access to Library Facilities</H1>

<P> 
The Rutgers University Libraries include 13 different physical facilities containing  21  libraries,
centers, and collections. There are also separate facilities  for  libraries  for  alcohol  studies,
criminal justice, management and labor relations, and two law schools that coordinate with but  that
are not administratively part of the Rutgers University Libraries.

</FONT></U>
<H1>User Conduct and Security</H1>

<P> 
The Libraries strive on behalf of all users to provide a quiet, welcoming, and respectful atmosphere
that is conducive to private study and research and that is comfortable, clean, and  safe  for  both
library users and personnel. The Libraries are committed to  protecting  the  rights  of  individual
users and sustaining the integrity of the collections. The Libraries abide by the
<U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>Code of Student Conduct</EM></FONT></U>, 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>Acceptable Use Policy for Computing and  Information  Technology Resources</EM></FONT></U>, 
other university policies, and applicable state and federal laws. Users who do  not
adhere to the following behavior guidelines may be asked to leave and may be subjected to  loss  of
library privileges, appropriate administrative action within the university, and prosecution  under
state law:
</P>

</FONT></U>
<P> 
<EM>Animals</EM> - Users with disabilities may bring assistance animals into the Libraries. No other animals are allowed. 
</P>

<P>
<EM>Appropriate Use of the Libraries</EM> - Library users should be engaged in activities associated with the use of an academic library while in Rutgers library facilities. These uses include reading, studying, or using library services or resources. Users not engaged in these activities will be required to leave the building. 
</P>

<P>
<EM>Appropriate Use of Facilities and Equipment</EM> - Facilities and equipment are to be used for the purposes for which they are provided. Such facilities as group study rooms and restrooms are provided for the convenience of all library users, and conduct unrelated to ordinary use is prohibited. Equipment, including public computers, is intended to support university instruction and research programs, and such uses are given priority. 
</P>

<P>
<EM>Cell Phones, Pagers, and Other Electronic Devices</EM> - The Rutgers University Libraries require library users to set cell phones, pagers, and other electronic devices on nonaudible signals. The use of these devices disturbs those engaged in quiet reading and other scholarly pursuits. 
</P>

<P>
<EM>Children's Use of the Libraries and Electronic Resources</EM> - Children or adolescents, under the age of 18, with no university affiliation, must be accompanied by a parent or guardian at all times. Parents or adult guardians who bring children to the library are responsible for their protection and safety and must never leave children unattended. Children are expected to abide by all library user conduct and security policies. When a young child is in the library unattended by a parent or adult guardian, university police will be called to ensure the safety of the child and to assist in locating a parent or guardian. Parents or adult guardians are responsible for children's use of the Libraries, including access to the Internet.  Library personnel may request identification to verify the age and university affiliation of any unaccompanied young person. 
</P>

<P> 
<EM>Destruction or Mutilation of Library Materials</EM> - The Libraries are responsible for custodial care of the inventory of library resources for the benefit of the overall community. No person should willfully, maliciously, or wantonly mutilate, deface, tear, write upon, mar, or injure any library materials, electronic resources, furnishings, equipment, or facilities. 
</P>

</FONT></U>
<P> 
<EM>Food and Drink</EM>
</P>


<P>
Rutgers University Libraries' food and drink policy is intended not only to preserve our library collections and equipment and to maintain the overall longevity and comfort of library furnishings but also to provide an environment respectful of all students' study needs. 
</P>

<P>
<EM>Food</EM> is allowed only in 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>designated spaces</FONT></U> in the Libraries or at library-approved events. 
</P>

<P>
<EM>Drink</EM> is permitted only in spill-proof containers. Drinks, regardless of container, are not permitted in posted areas such as Special Collections and University Archives, the Art Library, the Library Annex, and computer areas. 
</P>

<P>
Approved spill-proof containers include:
</P>

<UL>
<LI> Spill-proof mugs with secure lids</LI>

<EM>Non-Compliance</EM><BR>
Users who do not comply with these policies will be asked to take the food  or  drink  outside
the Libraries.
</P>




<P>
<EM>Noise and Other Disruptive Behavior</EM> - Library users expect the Libraries to be a quiet place for study and research. All library users are required to be courteous of others and refrain from harassing or annoying others through noisy or boisterous activities, by staring at another person with the intent to annoy that person, by following another person about the building with the intent to annoy that person, by playing audio equipment so that others can hear it, by singing or talking loudly to others or in monologues, or by behaving in a manner which reasonably can be expected to disturb other users. Talking will, however, occur as librarians and library staff provide assistance to library users. 
</P>


</FONT></U>
<P>
<EM>Personal Hygiene</EM> - Users whose bodily hygiene is offensive so as to constitute a nuisance to other persons shall be required to leave the building. 
</P>

</FONT></U>
<P> 
<EM>Photographs or Films</EM> - Anyone wishing to take photographs or make films in a Rutgers library must seek permission from the library director or the Associate University Librarian for Facilities Planning and Management. 
</P>

</FONT></U>
<P> 
<EM>Smoking</EM> - University regulations forbid smoking in any university building. 
</P>

<P> 
<EM>Staff Areas</EM> - To assure the safety and productivity of librarians and library staff, unauthorized individuals are not permitted in staff areas unless invited to enter by staff as necessary for the conduct of library business. 
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Use of Library Facilities for Television Viewing</H1>

<P>
Television viewing facilities in the Libraries are intended to support university instruction and research programs. Use of these rooms for viewing library television stations for course-related programming or for group study will receive the highest priority. Other uses, such as viewing other Rutgers television channels, are possible when the rooms are not being used for these priority purposes. These facilities are provided for the convenience of all library users, and conduct unrelated to ordinary use is prohibited. Use of these facilities falls under the same policies for other library spaces, such as use by children and user conduct and security.

<H1>Appendix   2<BR>   
The   Freedom   to   Read Statement</H1>


<P>
The freedom to read is essential to our democracy. It  is  continuously  under  attack.  Private
groups and public authorities in various parts of the country are working  to  remove  or  limit
access to reading materials, to censor content in schools, to label  "controversial"  views,  to
distribute lists of "objectionable" books or authors, and  to  purge  libraries.  These  actions
apparently rise from a view that our national tradition of free expression is no  longer  valid;
that censorship and suppression are needed to counter threats to safety or national security, as
well as to avoid the subversion of politics and the corruption of  morals.  We,  as  individuals
devoted to reading and as librarians and publishers responsible for disseminating ideas, wish to
assert the public interest in the preservation of the freedom to read.
</P>

<P>
Most attempts at suppression rest on a denial of the fundamental premise of democracy: that  the
ordinary individual, by exercising critical judgment, will select the good and reject  the  bad.
We trust Americans to recognize propaganda and misinformation, and to make their  own  decisions
about what they read and believe. We do  not  believe  they  are  prepared  to  sacrifice  their
heritage of a free press in order to be "protected" against what others think  may  be  bad  for
them. We believe they still favor free enterprise in ideas and expression.
</P>

<P>
These efforts at suppression are related to a larger pattern of pressures being brought  against
education, the press, art and images, films, broadcast media, and the Internet. The  problem  is
not only one of actual censorship. The shadow of fear cast by these pressures leads, we suspect,
to an even larger voluntary curtailment of expression by those who seek to avoid controversy  or
unwelcome scrutiny by government officials.
</P>

<P>
Such pressure toward conformity is perhaps natural to a time  of  accelerated  change.  And  yet
suppression is never more dangerous than in such a time of social tension. Freedom has given the
United States the elasticity to endure strain. Freedom keeps open the path of novel and creative
solutions, and enables change to come by choice. Every silencing of a heresy, every  enforcement
of an orthodoxy, diminishes the toughness and resilience of our society and leaves it  the  less
able to deal with controversy and difference.
</P>

<P>
Now as always in our history, reading is among our greatest freedoms. The freedom  to  read  and
write is almost the only means for making generally available ideas  or  manners  of  expression
that can initially command only a small audience. The written word is the natural medium for the
new idea and the untried voice from which come the original contributions to social  growth.  It
is essential to the extended discussion that serious thought requires, and to  the  accumulation
of knowledge and ideas into organized collections.
</P>

<P>
We believe that free communication is essential to the preservation of  a  free  society  and  a
creative culture. We believe that these  pressures  toward  conformity  present  the  danger  of
limiting the range and variety of inquiry and expression on which our democracy and our  culture
depend. We believe that every American community must jealously guard the freedom to publish and
to circulate, in order to preserve its own freedom to  read.  We  believe  that  publishers  and
librarians have a profound responsibility to give validity to that freedom to read by making  it
possible for the readers to choose freely from a variety of offerings.
</P>

<P>
The freedom to read is guaranteed by the Constitution. Those with  faith  in  free  people  will
stand firm on these  constitutional  guarantees  of  essential  rights  and  will  exercise  the
responsibilities that accompany these rights.
</P>

<P>
We therefore affirm these propositions:
</P>

<OL START="1">
<LI>  <EM>It is in the public interest for publishers and librarians to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions, including those that are unorthodox, unpopular, or considered dangerous by the majority.</EM>
<BR><BR>
      Creative thought is by definition new, and what is new is different. The bearer of every new thought is a rebel until that idea is refined and tested. Totalitarian systems attempt to maintain themselves in power by the ruthless suppression of any concept that challenges the established orthodoxy. The power of a democratic system to adapt to change is vastly strengthened by the freedom of its citizens to choose widely from among conflicting opinions offered freely to them. To stifle every nonconformist idea at birth would mark the end of the democratic process. Furthermore, only through the constant activity of weighing and selecting can the democratic mind attain the strength demanded by times like these. We need to know not only what we believe but why we believe it.
</LI>
</OL>

<OL START="2">
<LI> <EM>Publishers, librarians, and booksellers do not need to endorse every idea or presentation they make available. It would conflict with the public interest for them to establish their own political, moral, or aesthetic views as a standard for determining what should be published or circulated.</EM>
<BR><BR>
      Publishers and librarians serve the educational process by helping to make available knowledge and ideas required for the growth of the mind and the increase of learning. They do not foster education by imposing as mentors the patterns of their own thought. The people should have the freedom to read and consider a broader range of ideas than those that may be held by any single librarian or publisher or government or church. It is wrong that what one can read should be confined to what another thinks proper.
</LI>
</OL>

<OL START="3">
<LI>  <EM>It is contrary to the public interest for publishers or librarians to bar access to writings on the basis of the personal history or political affiliations of the author.</EM>
<BR><BR>
      No art or literature can flourish if it is to be measured by the political views or private lives of its creators. No society of free people can flourish that draws up lists of writers to whom it will not listen, whatever they may have to say.
</LI>
</OL>

<OL START="4">
<LI>  <EM>There is no place in our society for efforts to coerce the taste of others, to confine adults to the reading matter deemed suitable for adolescents, or to inhibit the efforts of writers to achieve artistic expression.</EM>
<BR><BR>
      To some, much of modern expression is shocking. But is not much of life itself shocking? We cut off literature at the source if we prevent writers from dealing with the stuff of life. Parents and teachers have a responsibility to prepare the young to meet the diversity of experiences in life to which they will be exposed, as they have a responsibility to help them learn to think critically for themselves. These are affirmative responsibilities, not to be discharged simply by preventing them from reading works for which they are not yet prepared. In these matters values differ, and values cannot be legislated; nor can machinery be devised that will suit the demands of one group without limiting the freedom of others.
</LI>
</OL>

<OL START="5">
<LI> <EM>It is not in the public interest to force a reader to accept the prejudgment of a label characterizing any expression or its author as subversive or dangerous.</EM>
<BR><BR>
      The ideal of labeling presupposes the existence of individuals or groups with wisdom to determine by authority what is good or bad for others. It presupposes that individuals must be directed in making up their minds about the ideas they examine. But Americans do not need others to do their thinking for them.
</LI>
</OL>

<OL START="6">
<LI>  <EM>It is the responsibility of publishers and librarians, as guardians of the people's freedom to read, to contest encroachments upon that freedom by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own standards or tastes upon the community at large; and by the government whenever it seeks to reduce or deny public access to public information.</EM>
<BR><BR>
      It is inevitable in the give and take of the democratic process that the political, the moral, or the aesthetic concepts of an individual or group will occasionally collide with those of another individual or group. In a free society individuals are free to determine for themselves what they wish to read, and each group is free to determine what it will recommend to its freely associated members. But no group has the right to take the law into its own hands, and to impose its own concept of politics or morality upon other members of a democratic society. Freedom is no freedom if it is accorded only to the accepted and the inoffensive. Further, democratic societies are more safe, free, and creative when the free flow of public information is not restricted by governmental prerogative or self-censorship.
</LI>
</OL>

<OL START="7">
<LI> <EM>It is the responsibility of publishers and librarians to give full meaning to the freedom to read by providing books that enrich the quality and diversity of thought and expression. By the exercise of this affirmative responsibility, they can demonstrate that the answer to a "bad" book is a good one, the answer to a "bad" idea is a good one.</EM>
<BR><BR>
      The freedom to read is of little consequence when the reader cannot obtain matter fit for that reader's purpose. What is needed is not only the absence of restraint, but the positive provision of opportunity for the people to read the best that has been thought and said. Books are the major channel by which the intellectual inheritance is handed down, and the principal means of its testing and growth. The defense of the freedom to read requires of all publishers and librarians the utmost of their faculties, and deserves of all Americans the fullest of their support.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
We state these propositions neither lightly nor as easy generalizations. We  here  stake  out  a
lofty claim for the value of the written word. We do so because we believe that it is  possessed
of enormous variety and usefulness, worthy of cherishing and keeping free. We realize  that  the
application of these propositions may mean the dissemination of ideas and manners of  expression
that are repugnant to many persons. We do not state these propositions in the comfortable belief
that what people read is unimportant.  We  believe  rather  that  what  people  read  is  deeply
important; that ideas can be dangerous; but  that  the  suppression  of  ideas  is  fatal  to  a
democratic society. Freedom itself is a dangerous way of life, but it is ours.

<H1>Appendix   3<BR>   The   Freedom   to   View
Statement</H1>

<P> 
The FREEDOM TO VIEW, along with the freedom to speak, to hear, and to read,  is  protected  by  the
First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In a free society,  there  is  no  place  for
censorship of any medium of expression. Therefore these principles are  affirmed:  
</P>  

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>
<P>
To provide the broadest access to film, video, and other audiovisual  materials  because  they
are a means for the communication  of  ideas.  Liberty  of  circulation  is  essential  to  insure  the
constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
To protect the confidentiality of all individuals and  institutions  using  film,  video,  and
other audiovisual materials. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
To provide film, video, and other audiovisual materials which represent a diversity  of  views
and expression. Selection of a work does not constitute or imply agreement  with  or  approval  of  the
content. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
To provide a diversity of viewpoints without the constraint of labeling  or  prejudging  film,
video, or other audiovisual materials on the basis of the moral, religious, or political beliefs of the
producer or filmmaker or on the basis of controversial content. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
To contest vigorously, by all lawful means, every encroachment upon the  public's  freedom  to
view. This statement was originally drafted by the Freedom to View Committee of the American  Film  and
Video Association (formerly the Educational Film Library Association) and was adopted by the AFVA Board
of Directors in February 1979. This statement was updated and approved by the AFVA Board  of  Directors
in 1989.

<H1>Appendix 4<BR>
 Intellectual  Freedom  Principles for Academic Libraries</H1>

<P>
 A strong intellectual freedom perspective is  critical  to  the  development  of  academic  library
collections and services that dispassionately meet the education and research needs  of  a  college  or
university community. The purpose of  this  statement  is  to  provide  an  interpretation  of  general
intellectual freedom principles in an academic library setting and, in the process, raise consciousness
of the intellectual freedom context within which academic librarians work. These principles  should  be
reflected in all relevant library policy documents. 
</P>


<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>
<P>
 The general principles  set  forth  in  the  Library  Bill  of  Rights  form  an
indispensable framework for building collections, services, and policies that serve the entire academic
community. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
The privacy of library users is and must be inviolable.  Policies  should  be  in  place  that
maintain confidentiality of library borrowing records and of other information relating to personal use
of library information and services. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
The development of library collections in support of an institution's instruction and research
programs should transcend the personal values of  the  selector.  In  the  interests  of  research  and
learning, it is essential that collections contain materials representing a variety of perspectives  on
subjects that may be considered controversial. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Preservation and replacement efforts should  ensure  that  balance  in  library  materials  is
maintained and that controversial materials are not removed from the collections through  theft,  loss,
mutilation, or normal wear and tear. There should be alertness to efforts by special interest groups to
bias a collection though systematic theft or mutilation. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Licensing agreements should be consistent with the Library Bill of Rights, and should maximize
access. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Open and unfiltered access to the Internet should be conveniently available  to  the  academic
community in a college or university library. Content filtering devices and content-based  restrictions
are a contradiction of the academic library mission to further research and learning  through  exposure
to the broadest possible range of ideas and information. Such restrictions are a fundamental  violation
of intellectual freedom in academic libraries. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Freedom of information and of creative expression should be reflected in library exhibits  and
in all relevant library policy documents. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Library meeting rooms, research carrels,  exhibit  spaces,  and  other  facilities  should  be
available to the academic community regardless of research being pursued or  subject  being  discussed.
Any restrictions made necessary because of limited availability of space should be based  on  need,  as
reflected in library policy, rather than on content of research or discussion. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Whenever possible, library services should be available without charge in order  to  encourage
inquiry. Where charges are necessary, a free or low-cost alternative (e.g., downloading to disc  rather
than printing) should be available when possible. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
A service philosophy should be promoted that affords equal access to information  for  all  in
the academic community with no discrimination on the basis of race, values, gender, sexual orientation,
cultural or ethnic background, physical or learning disability, economic status, religious beliefs,  or
views. 
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
A procedure ensuring due process should be in place to deal with requests by those within  and
outside the academic community for removal or addition of library  resources,  exhibits,  or  services.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
It is recommended that this statement of principle be endorsed  by  appropriate  institutional
governing bodies, including the faculty senate or similar instrument of faculty  governance.
