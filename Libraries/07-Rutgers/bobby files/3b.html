<P>
Rutgers University students, faculty, and staff who are currently enrolled or employed are eligible  to  check  out  books,
request delivery of books and articles, book media for preview and classroom use, and use the MY ACCOUNT features available
in the Library Catalog.
</P>

 
										

</FONT></U>
<H1>Borrower Registration</H1>

<P>
To begin using the Libraries you need to register your barcode. Your barcode is the 14-digit number  beginning  '29030'  on
the back of your RUconnection card. Newark Law patrons may have barcodes beginning '25145.' If you do not yet have  one,  a
barcode will be assigned to you.
</P>

<P>
You may register by filling out the online "<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Registering with the Rutgers Libraries</FONT></U>"  form available  on  the  Libraries'
website, or by visiting or phoning the circulation desk of any Rutgers library. If you register online or by phone, provide
your Rutgers NetID for verification purposes and your barcode if you have one. If  you  visit  a  circulation  desk,
present a valid RUconnection card or proof of current registration or employment.
</P>

<P>
Once you have registered with the Libraries, your RUconnection card is your  library  card  and  is  to  be  used  for  all
borrowing transactions. 
You may use your Rutgers NetID and password to renew books online, request delivery of books, check the  status  of  your  requests,  and logon to the Libraries website from off-campus.  
</P>


 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Borrower Responsibilities</H1>

<P>
As a registered borrower with the Rutgers University Libraries you are required to:
</P>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Account for all items checked out on your card.</EM> Your barcode is linked to the unique  barcodes  of  library  materials
that you check out. You are responsible for all items checked out on your card. RUconnection cards are nontransferable  and
should not be loaned to others. Report lost or stolen cards to the RUConnection Office and at the circulation desk  of  any
Rutgers library.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Know due dates and return or renew materials on time.</EM> Due dates may change based on recalls and renewals. Check  your  MY
ACCOUNT for a list of your checkouts and their due dates.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Read your email messages and library notices.</EM> Whenever you travel or are away from campus, arrange  to  have  your  email
notices read or forwarded. Or, alternatively, return all library materials before extended absences  from  campus.  Library
fines will not be waived if you fail to read email and respond to recall and  overdue  notices.  
"Pick  up  materials  you
requested when they arrive at your pickup library. You will  be  notified  by  email  when  materials  from  other  Rutgers
libraries, E-ZBorrow books, and interlibrary loan materials are available. Materials are held for limited  times.  If  your
need for requested materials changes, please cancel your request.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Care for library materials.</EM> Return books and other library materials unmarked and in good condition.  You  will  be  held
responsible for materials returned damaged. If the book you wish to  charge  out  is  already  damaged,  bring  it  to  the
attention of circulation desk staff, who will make note of the damage so that you will not be held responsible.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Maintain a current address and email address with the university.</EM> It  is  important  that  you  regularly  maintain  your
directory information in the Rutgers Online Directory, which is the source of address information in your  library  record.
Instructions on how to do this may be found online at <U><FONT COLOR=blue>http://search.rutgers.edu/changes.shtml</FONT></U>.
</LI>
</UL>


 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Loan Periods</H1>

<P>
Faculty, staff, and graduate students may borrow books for a full semester. Undergraduates may borrow books  for  28  days.
The loan period for E-ZBorrow books and interlibrary loan materials is generally 28 days.
</P>

<P>
If you borrow a book that is in demand and has been requested or recalled by another borrower, you may check it out for  14
days. All books, regardless of loan period, are subject to recall and may be assigned a new due date.
</P>

<P>
CDs, audio cassettes, discs, and tapes circulate to faculty, staff  and  graduate  students  for  14
days; CDs also circulate to undergraduates for 3 days. Videos and DVDs circulate to faculty,  staff,
and graduate students for 3 days; Music Library DVDs also circulate to undergraduates for 3 days. 16
and 8mm films do not circulate; they are available only with special permission. Slides, film loops,
filmstrips, and kits circulate to faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduates for 14 days.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Renewals</H1>

<P>
You may renew most items yourself using the "Renew Checkouts" feature in your MY ACCOUNT. Materials that cannot be  renewed
include items that have been recalled by another borrower, reserve materials, and items for which  the  renewal  limit  has
been reached. Video and audio items are not eligible for renewal.
</P>

 


</FONT></U>
<H1>Recalls</H1>

<P>
You may recall an item checked out to another borrower using the "Book Delivery/Recall" feature in  the Library Catalog.  The  person  who
currently has the item is notified to bring it back within 14 days. When the item is available, you  will  be  notified  by
email and in your MY ACCOUNT file. Video and audio items are not eligible for recall.
</P>

<P>
Alternatively, whenever all Rutgers copies of a book are checked out, you may search the PALCI catalog and if the  item  is
available, place an E-ZBorrow request for quick delivery from another academic library.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Missing Items</H1>

<P>
If you cannot find an item on the shelf, please report it missing at the circulation desk. Library staff  will  change  its
status to MISSING, and you may then request it from another Rutgers Library in the Library Catalog, from a PALCI library using  E-ZBorrow,
or on interlibrary loan.
</P>



 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Returns</H1>

<P>
Return borrowed books to a circulation desk or book drop of any Rutgers library on or before their due dates. You may  also
return materials by USPS or a commercial delivery service.
</P>

 


</FONT></U>
<H1>Reserves</H1>

<P>
Items requested by instructors for use by an entire class are placed "on reserve" with short loan periods. Books and  media
on reserve may be checked out for use in the library. Electronic documents  on  reserve  are  available  at  public  access
workstations in the libraries, in campus computer labs, and PCs connected to the campus network.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Request and Delivery Services</H1>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Rutgers Delivery Service.</EM> If an item is on the shelf at any  Rutgers  library,
in-process, or pending, we will deliver it to your pickup library. Use the "Book  Delivery/  Recall"
feature in the Library Catalog. Video and audio items are not eligible for the Rutgers Delivery  Service.  Use  the
"Book Special Request" feature  to  request  materials  that  are  on-order  and  delivery  of  non-
circulating books to another  campus  (Camden  New  Brunswick,  Newark)  for  in-library  use.  When
materials are delivered to your pickup library you will be notified by email and in your MY ACCOUNT.
Request Rutgers journal articles by  logging  onto  the  "Interlibrary  Loan  and  Article  Delivery
Services" web page and using the "Article Request" form. Articles will be  delivered  electronically
as PDF documents.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>E-ZBorrow.</EM> Search the PALCI (Pennsylvania Academic Library Consortium, Inc.) catalog and use E-ZBorrow to  request  quick
delivery of books from over fifty academic libraries.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Media Bookings.</EM> Rutgers faculty, staff, and graduate students may book video and audio items for  pickup  and  return  at
locations throughout the Rutgers University Libraries at the "Media Materials -Booking Form" website. The service may  also
be used to preview materials.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Interlibrary Loan.</EM> Interlibrary loan services expand the resources  available  to  the  Rutgers  community  beyond  those
available at the university. Materials available on loan from other institutions may include books, newspapers,  documents,
periodical articles, dissertations, and similar materials that are needed  locally  for  academic  purposes.  Articles  and
photocopies received from other institutions will be delivered electronically as PDF documents. Interlibrary  loan  request
forms are available by logging on to the "Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services" website.</LI>
</UL>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Fines, Notices, and Replacement Charges</H1>

<P>
Borrowers who fail to return recalled books by the new due date, indicated on the recall notice, will be fined $5  per  day
to a maximum of $50. Failure to return course reserve items within established loan periods will result in a  $1  per  hour
fine for each hour overdue up to $25. Overdue  notices  are  sent  when  items  are  seven  and  twenty-one  days  overdue.
Replacement bills for the average replacement and processing cost of $102 per  book  are  sent  when  items  are  180  days
overdue. You may contact the circulation department of any Rutgers library for the actual replacement cost of lost items items and the average replacement costs of video and audio materials.
</P>

<P>
Borrowers with fines and/or replacement bills will have their library  privileges  suspended  and  holds  placed  on  their
library records. The university reserves the right to hold transcripts and diplomas if you do not pay your obligations.  As
a result of non-payment it will become necessary to forward delinquent accounts to a collection agency, which  would  incur
an additional fee to you.
</P>


 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Identification</H1>

<P>
You must present a valid borrower card with barcode when charging out books. No other identification is
acceptable. Borrower cards are nontransferable and should not  be  loaned  to  other  people.  If  your
borrower card is lost or stolen, immediately report it to staff at the circulation desk of any  Rutgers
library.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Change of Address</H1>

<P>
It is the responsibility of Rutgers students, faculty, and staff to keep the university informed of any address changes. Students, faculty, and staff receive library notices during the academic year and during the summer at their email address currently on file with the university in the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Rutgers  Online  Directory</FONT></U>, 
which is the source of address information in library records. The Libraries get email addresses for teaching, graduate, and research assistants from their student records only. Users who do not have an email address on file with the university or libraries will receive paper notices at their campus mail address during the academic year and their home mail address during the summer.
</P>

<P>
To change your email address, go to the
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Rutgers Online Directory</FONT></U>, 
available on the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Rutgers</FONT></U> main web 
page under "SEARCH RUTGERS for people, buildings &amp; more." 
Select the radio button next to "People." 
Enter and search for your name; verify your email address on your "Person Display Screen." To make changes, click on 
"<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Changes and Corrections</FONT></U>" 
on the opening search screen and select the appropriate student or employee online form. Enter your NetID, the username and password associated with your Rutgers email account. If you need assistance, contact Computing Services 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>HELP</FONT></U> on your campus.
on your campus. Please enter the entire e-mail  address  that  you  wish  to  be  on  record,
including the  host  name  (e.g.  andromeda.rutgers.edu,  rci.rutgers.edu,  aol.com).  E-mail
addresses from commercial providers are acceptable. Updates to the Rutgers  Online  Directory
are usually posted to library records within two weeks. Faculty and  staff  may  also  obtain
paper Address Directory Record (ADR) forms through their department.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Non-Circulating Items</H1>

<P>
Certain materials are considered crucial to academic research and for that reason  they  must
always be available in the libraries. Items such as current and  bound  periodicals,  certain
government documents, and materials in the reference collection, will  be  shared  among  the
libraries on the major geographical campuses (Newark, New Brunswick/Piscataway,  and  Camden)
for 5 days of in-library use, but are not eligible to check out.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Hours</H1>

<P>
While classes are in session, the larger Rutgers libraries are open Monday through  Thursday,
8 a.m. to at least 11 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday hours  vary  by  library.  Circulation
desk hours may vary from library building hours.
</P>

<P>
Library hours change during semester breaks, intersessions, exam periods, and university holidays. Check the Rutgers University Libraries web site 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>hours</FONT></U> or hours
posted in the libraries for exceptions and changes.
</P>

 


</FONT></U>
<H1>Questions</H1>

<P>
If you have questions regarding borrowing privileges, telephone or visit the circulation 
department of any Rutgers library, or use the online 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Ask a Librarian</FONT></U> service.
