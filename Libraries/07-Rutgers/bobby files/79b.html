<P>
The Rutgers University Libraries are a member of the Pennsylvania Academic Library Consortium,
Inc. (PALCI) and participate in PALCI's E-ZBorrow program for the expedited delivery of books.
Participating libraries include Carnegie Mellon, Pennsylvania State and  Temple  Universities,
and the Universities of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Journal articles are  not
available through this service.
</P>

 
</FONT></U>

<H2>Eligibility</H2>

<P>
Rutgers University students, faculty, and staff are eligible to search the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>E-ZBorrow Discovery Interface</FONT></U>  
and  place  E-ZBorrow  requests.  Borrowers in affiliated programs who are eligible for interlibrary loan service may also use E-ZBorrow.   Students, faculty, and staff at remote locations are eligible, but delivery is only to on-campus libraries.  If you are not affiliated with Rutgers or another participating institution, you may not search the PALCI catalog. 
</P>

 
</FONT></U>

<H2>How to Place an E-ZBorrow Request</H2>

<P>
Connect to the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>E-ZBorrow Discovery Interface</FONT></U> 
by entering your Rutgers NetID and password on  the  E-ZBorrow  log-in  screen.  Borrowers  in
affiliated programs who are eligible for E-ZBorrow may login with their library  barcodes  and
PINs.
</P>

<P>
The E-ZBorrow Discovery page defaults to the simple search entry. If you  wish  to  perform  a
more advanced search, click on the "Advanced Search"  link  below  the  search  box.  Advanced
search supports phrase and Boolean searches.
</P>

<P>
Enter your search terms and click on "Search." The catalogs of all participating libraries are
searched at the same time. By default, results display  in  order  of  relevance  but  can  be
changed on-the-fly to sort by title, newest, or oldest.
</P>

<P>
Click on a title to view more details. If there  is  a  copy  within  E-ZBorrow  available  to
request, you will see the message "Click here to request this item from E-ZBorrow."  Select  a
Rutgers pickup library from the drop down list, and add any notes that are  relevant  to  your
request, for example, to indicate the specific volumes of a multi-volume set  that  you  need.
Click on "Request."
</P>

<P>
You will see a message on the screen confirming that your request was submitted,  including  a
request number prefixed with "RTG" for Rutgers. You will also receive a  request  confirmation
email.
</P>

<P>
If a book is available at Rutgers, you will be given the option to transfer to the Library Catalog and  place
a request for it. If a title is held but not available through E-ZBorrow, you  will  be  given
the option to transfer to "ILL and Article Delivery" and place a request for it. After you log
into ILL, the item's bibliographic  information  will  automatically  populate  the  ILL  book
request form.
</P>


 
</FONT></U>

<H2>Guidelines for Placing Requests</H2>

<P>
Use E-ZBorrow to request books either not owned, checked out, or otherwise  not  available  in
the Rutgers University Libraries. Requests may be placed for books charged out to or  on  hold
for another Rutgers borrower, available only as a reference or reserve item at Rutgers,  noted
as missing in the Library Catalog, and in a non-circulating library or collection. Journal articles  are  not
available through this service.
</P>

<P>
Books that normally circulate from participating libraries will be loaned. Journals or journal
articles, e-books, films, videos, CDs, and rare materials are generally not eligible.  If  you
need a photocopy of an article from a journal not owned at Rutgers, please request it  through 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery</FONT></U>.
</P>

<P>
The target time frame for delivery to any Rutgers pick-up library is 5-7 working days. If your
request cannot be filled by E-ZBorrow, you will be notified and asked if you wish  to  request
your book through interlibrary loan.
</P>




 
</FONT></U>

<H2>Borrowing Conditions</H2>

<P>
The loan period for E-ZBorrow books is 28 days for all borrowers. One renewal is  allowed  for
an additional 28 days. Books will be held for 14 days and if not picked up will be returned to
the lending library. The PALCI libraries have cooperatively agreed to this loan period.
</P>

<P>
When an E-ZBorrow book is recalled,  you  will  receive  an  email  notice  from  the  Rutgers
University Libraries with a new 7 day due date. Rutgers libraries recall fines will apply if a
book borrowed from a PALCI library is not returned by its new due date.  Borrowing  privileges
at Rutgers University Libraries will be suspended if recall fines are owed or E-ZBorrow  books
are overdue.
</P>

<P>
Like other interlibrary resource sharing  programs,  E-ZBorrow  is  based  on  reciprocal  and
cooperative  agreements  with  other  libraries.  These  partnerships  were  formed  with  the
understanding that the borrowing library and individual borrower have  the  responsibility  to
treat the borrowed materials as they would the property of their own  library  and  to  return
them within established time frames in good  condition.  Failure  to  do  so  jeopardizes  our
ability to continue cooperative arrangements with these institutions in the future.
</P>


 
</FONT></U>

<H2>Renewals</H2>

<P>
E-ZBorrow books may be renewed in the Library Catalog "MY ACCOUNT" for one additional 28-day loan period. The
28-day renewal loan takes effect on the day you make the renewal; 28 days  are  not  added  to
your original due date unless you wait to renew  on  that  date.  E-ZBorrow  books  cannot  be
renewed if they are not renewed within seven (7) days from the initial due date.
</P>

 
</FONT></U>

<H2>Cancellations</H2>

<P>
If you wish to cancel an E-ZBorrow request, write to 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Ask A Librarian</FONT></U> and include the RTG-request number.  
</P>


 

</FONT></U>

<H2>Fees</H2>

<P>
There is no charge to you for E-ZBorrow unless you lose or damage a borrowed book.   Replacement charges and processing fees for lost E-ZBorrow materials are assessed at $102 per item when they are seven days overdue.
</P>

 
</FONT></U>

<H2>Notification and Delivery</H2>

<P>
You will be notified by email at your email address on  file  with  the  Libraries  when  your
request has been placed. To view a list of your E-ZBorrow requests,  logon  to  the  
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>E-ZBorrow Discovery Interface</FONT></U> 
and click on "My Account."
</P>

<P>
You will receive another email notification when E-ZBorrow books arrive and are being held for
you at your pickup library. You will also be notified about  book  availability  in  your  "MY
ACCOUNT" file in the Library Catalog.
</P>


 
</FONT></U>

<H2>About PALCI</H2>

<P>
The Pennsylvania Academic Library Consortium, Inc. (PALCI) is a membership organization formed
in 1996 as a grassroots federation of private  and  public  academic  libraries.  The  primary
mission of the group is to spur the development of library cooperation within the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, and its focus has been the improvement  of  virtual  library  services  among
member institutions. In addition to development of the E-ZBorrow service, PALCI has negotiated
consortium licensing agreements for databases and electronic journals.  A  list  of  libraries
participating in the PALCI virtual union catalog and E-ZBorrow program  is  available  on  the
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>PALCI website</FONT></U>.  Rutgers is the first library outside the Commonwealth invited to participate in
PALCI activities.
</P>
