<P>  
Interlibrary loan services expand the resources available to the Rutgers community beyond  those
at the university. The Rutgers University Libraries maintain memberships in consortia  and  have
special cooperative arrangements with libraries and other organizations to provide  interlibrary
loan services for Rutgers faculty, students, and staff. Current partners  include  the  Research
Libraries Group (RLG), OCLC (Online Computer  Library  Center),  the  Virtual  Academic  Library
Network (VALE), the New  Jersey  Library  Network,  the  Eastern  New  Jersey  Regional  Library
Cooperative (INFOLINK), the South Jersey Regional Library Cooperative (SJRLC), the  Metropolitan
New York Library Council (METRO), the Pennsylvania Academic Library Consortia, Inc. (PALCI), the
International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA),  and  the  Center  for
Research Libraries (CRL).
</P>

<P>
Materials available on loan   from  other  institutions  may  include  books,  newspapers,  documents,
periodical articles, dissertations, and similar materials that are needed locally for academic purposes. 
Electronic documents and photocopies received from other institutions are converted to PDF files 
and delivered electronically to user's desktops.
</P>

 


</FONT></U>
<H1>Eligibility</H1>

<P>
Rutgers University students, faculty, and staff may use this service including students, faculty, and  staff  at  remote
locations. Students, faculty, and staff teaching or taking courses on the Camden Urban Campus of Camden  County  College
or Rowan University; 
and UMDNJ students, faculty, housestaff, and staff covered by the 
reciprocal agreement between Rutgers University Libraries and the 
University Libraries of UMDNJ,  are also eligible for Rutgers interlibrary loan service.
</P>

<P>
Law school students, faculty, and staff receive interlibrary loan services directly through  the  law  libraries.  Guest
borrowers receive interlibrary loan services through their local libraries.
</P>

 


</FONT></U>
<H1>How to Place an Interlibrary Loan Request</H1>

<P>
Please verify that the item you request  is  not  owned  by   Rutgers   before  submitting  an
interlibrary loan request. You can do this by checking the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library Catalog</FONT></U>  and/or
government documents card catalogs. Search also in PALCI's (Pennsylvania Academic  Libraries  Consortium,  Inc.)  online
catalog where you can  place  
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>E-ZBorrow</FONT></U> 
requests  for  quick delivery of books  not available at Rutgers.
</P>

<P>
Consult a reference librarian. The reference librarian may be able to determine that the material you want is located in
one of the Rutgers libraries, is available in another form, including online full text, is in an uncataloged collection,
or is available through another document delivery service. Reference librarians also welcome the opportunity  to  assist
in finding other relevant materials that are available at Rutgers.  In  addition,  the  reference  librarian  will  lend
assistance in completing the request form.
</P>

<P>
Interlibrary loan request forms are available 
under 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>DELIVERY AND INTERLIBRARY LOAN</FONT></U> on the Libraries' website.  
or by clicking on thte [ILL] button in the Library Catalog. On the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U>  
page, login with your NetID and password. Users who are eligible for interlibrary loan but
do not have a NetID may login with their library barcode and PIN. First time users will be
asked to register. On the main menu page choose the appropriate ILL Book Request,  Article
Request, or ILL Conference Proceedings Request form and fill in all items  of  information
called for on the form. Avoid using abbreviations in authors' names or journal titles.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Guidelines for Placing Requests</H1>

<P>
An interlibrary loan takes time. Submit requests at least fourteen days in advance of  the  time  the  materials  will  be
needed because it may take that long for the material to arrive. Items that can be borrowed from a library in New Jersey
or the New York metropolitan area usually arrive within fourteen days. It is often necessary to request material from  a
library outside of  the metropolitan area, or from several libraries, before an available copy can
be located. Articles that can be supplied by a member of the RAPID library consortium usually arrive within 24 hours.
</P>

<P>
The conditions of interlibrary loan are set by the National Interlibrary Loan Code of the American Library  Association.
The Rutgers library guidelines reflect those principles.
</P>

<P>
Interlibrary loan requests will be accepted for material not owned by the Libraries or: 
</P>

<UL>
<LI> at the Camden or Newark law library if your pickup library is on a different geographical campus</LI>
<LI> listed in the Library Catalog as "MISSING"</LI> 
<LI> the number of holds on an item in the Library Catalog is greater than the number of eligible copies</LI>
<LI> long overdue and billed for replacement</LI>
<LI> at the bindery or in poor condition</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Interlibrary loan requests cannot be accepted for materials that are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI> on reserve or on reference on the same geographical campus: Camden, Newark, or New Brunswick/Piscataway (all libraries)</LI>
<LI> "IN-PROCESS" that have been received at a Rutgers library or in central acquisitions (use the "Request Article/Other" option in the Library Catalog to request "IN-PROCESS" books.)</LI>
<LI> more than twice for the same title and same person within the same calendar year</LI>
<LI> in non-Roman alphabets without transliteration</LI>
<LI> textbooks</LI>
</UL>

 


</FONT></U>
<H1>Status Checks and Cancellations</H1>

<P>
You can check on the status of your requests  by  logging  on  to  <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery</FONT></U> . You will be presented with a list of your outstanding  requests  on  the
main menu. You can also click "Outstanding Requests" under "View" on the left menu bar  at
any time. Click on a request's transaction number to view its  "Transaction  Information."
Scroll down to "Tracking" where you will see the date/time and status of the request every
time it is updated by interlibrary loan staff.
</P>


<P>
To cancel a request select [Cancel Request] at the top of its  "Transaction  Information."
Cancelled requests will be listed under "Cancelled Requests." You will also receive  email
notification whenever an interlibrary loan request is canceled by  the  Libraries  and  it
will appear in your "Cancelled Requests" queue.
</P>


 


</FONT></U>
<H1>Borrowing Conditions</H1>

<P>
The loan period for most interlibrary loan books is four weeks. Books will be held for fourteen days and
if not picked up will be returned to the lending library. The lending library sets the loan  period,  including  renewal
policies, for the item and may also set special conditions for on-site use, such as "in library use only."  The  Rutgers
University Libraries abide by all conditions established by the lending library.
</P>

<P>
Interlibrary loan services are based on reciprocal and cooperative agreements with other libraries.  These  partnerships
were formed with the understanding that the borrowing library and individual accept  the  responsibility  to  treat  the
borrowed materials as they would the property of their own library and to return them within established time-frames  in
good condition. Failure to do  so  jeopardizes  the  Rutgers  University  Libraries'  ability  to  continue  cooperative
arrangements with these institutions in the future.
</P>

 


</FONT></U>
<H1>Renewals</H1>

<P>
You can renew most interlibrary loan books yourself for one additional 28-day loan period in 
your  Library Catalog  "MY ACCOUNT"
file. The 28-day renewal loan takes effect on the day you make the renewal; 28 days are not added to your original  due
date unless you wait to renew on that date. You cannot  renew  interlibrary  loan  materials  that  are  designated  
"No Renewal"  that have been recalled by the lending institution, for which the 
renewal limit has been reached, or that 
are not renewed within seven (7) days from the initial due date.
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Recalls</H1>

<P>
Interlibrary loan materials checked out to you may be recalled by the  lending  library.  
Rutgers  University  Libraries
recall fines will apply if the item is not returned within the newly established due date, seven days from the  date  of
recall. 
Your borrowing privileges will be suspended if recall fines are owed or interlibrary loan books are overdue.
</P>

 
</FONT></U>
<H1>Fines</H1>

<P>
Interlibrary loan materials are subject to  the  same  fines  as  materials  owned  by  Rutgers
University Libraries. Overdue Recall fines are assessed at $5 per day up to a maximum fine of
$50. Replacement charges for lost materials are assessed at $102 per item when  interlibrary
loan materials are seven days overdue. You may pay fines in the following manner:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>by check or cash at the circulation desks of Alexander, Chang, Douglass, 
Kilmer, Library of Science and Medicine, Camden, Dana (Newark) libraries,</LI>
<LI>by RU Express card at Alexander Library, or</LI>
<LI>by credit card at a cashier's office if you are on academic hold.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The University reserves the right to hold transcripts and diplomas if you do not pay your 
obligations, and to forward delinquent accounts to collection agencies 
and to levy a collection fee.
</P>

 


</FONT></U>
<H1>Fees</H1>

<P>
There is no charge to you for interlibrary loan unless the cost of the loan/photocopy exceeds $20. 
You will be notified before the request is made if there are charges to you beyond the $20 cap. 
</P>

 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Notification and Delivery</H1>

<P>
You will receive email notification at your email address on file with the 
libraries when interlibrary books arrive  and
are being held for you at your pickup library. 
You will also be notified about book availability in your 
"MY ACCOUNT" file in the Library Catalog under "Review Library Catalog Requests, Holds, and Recalls."  
If you requested delivery to an off-campus pickup site interlibrary loan books will be checked out to  you
before shipment.
</P>

<P>
When your articles arrive you will be notified at the email address currently  registered  in  your
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U>  user information record. To view your articles, log on
to <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Article Delivery Services</FONT></U> and under "View"  select  "Electronically  Received
Articles.".
</P>


 

</FONT></U>
<H1>Questions</H1>

<P>
Have a question about an interlibrary loan request?  Use the     
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Ask  a  Librarian</FONT></U>  
service to submit questions. Interlibrary loan services staff will respond to your question via email.
