<H1>Women on the Border: Maryland Perspectives of the Civil War</H1>





September 2011- July 13, 2012 
Maryland Room Gallery 
Hornbake Library 
University of Maryland 
College Park, Md


 

<P>During the 2011-2012 academic year Special Collections of the University of Maryland Libraries commemorate the sesquicentennial of the American 
Civil War with a <EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Symposium on "Women and the Civil War in Maryland"</FONT></U></EM> 
and a Maryland Room Gallery exhibition entitled "Women on the Border: Maryland Perspectives of the Civil War."  

<P>The symposium, which will take place on Friday, April 27, 2012, brings together local and national scholars from a variety of insitutions. Thavolia Glymph, Professor
of African American Studies and History at Duke University, will present the keynote address.  Please follow the symposium link
in the navigation bar above or more information about the symposium and to view the <EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>symposium program</FONT></U></EM>.    

<P>The gallery exhibition (and the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>online version</FONT></U> of the exhibition) seeks to demonstrate the importance of viewing American Civil War history 
through the lens of women's and gender history; to illustrate the particularities of living within the "border state" of Maryland; 
and to promote a deeper understanding of how historical documents are preserved, used, and interpreted. In addition, the exhibition 
showcases some of the University Libraries' rare and manuscript materials related to the Civil War, almost all of which are from 
the University Libraries' Special Collections. This exhibition focuses on the lives and experiences of ordinary women living in the state 
of Maryland during the war, using letters, diaries, photographs, sheet music, rare books, and other special collections materials as sources.</P>

<P>A companion exhibit entitled <U><FONT COLOR=blue> "A College Divided: Maryland Agricultural College and the Civil War"</FONT></U> is also on display in the Audrey Armistead Ruckert Reception Foyer of Hornbake Library.  This exhibit highlights the impact the Civil War had on the Maryland Agricultural College, then the name of the university's College Park campus, by exploring the varied roles played by students, stockholders, faculty, and administrators, on both sides of the conflict.</P>

<P>The Civil War had a profound impact on the state of Maryland and the United States.  We encourage visitors to take advantage of both of these exhibitions in Hornbake Library.
