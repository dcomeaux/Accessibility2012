<H2>General Library Information </FONT></U></H2>

<P><U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>Libraries' Hours</EM></FONT></U>. <EM> Note:</EM> Hours vary for the fall, spring, summer sessions and intersession (January, May, August) periods. <EM>Weather:</EM> During periods of inclement weather, verify that the campus &amp; Libraries are open by visiting the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>University&rsquo;s home page</FONT></U> or call 301-405-SNOW.</P>
<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Phone numbers.</FONT></U></EM> For general information call 301-405-0800. </P>
<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Code of Conduct Policy for Library Users</FONT></U></EM> is applicable to visitors, UM faculty, students and staff. </P>

<P><EM>Tours of the Libraries and its collections</EM>.  All libraries are open to the public, but there are no tours of the buildings offered. </P>

<P><EM>Virtual Tours</EM>. The <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Performing Arts Library</FONT></U> provides a  virtual tour of its facility. </P>

<P><EM><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Borrowing Materials from UM Libraries</FONT></U></EM>. The libraries have a variety of borrowing statuses depending on your affiliation with UM. </P>

<P><EM>Safety and Security</EM>. It only takes a minute for a thief to strike. Take responsibility for your personal property by not leaving items unattended not even briefly. </P>

<P><EM>Photography</EM>.  Photographers should comply with the guidelines below.<BR> 
1)  Minimize disruption. Lights, equipment, or loud noise may compromise users’ ability to accomplish their work. Be courteous.<BR>
2) Respect privacy. Libraries have long protected the confidentiality of their users, who expect to study in an environment that safeguards their anonymity if so desired. Do not photograph over student’s shoulder, for example, if it shows the content of his or her work. As a courtesy it's always best to get permission before taking somebody's photograph.
Note that audio recording of private conversations without the permission of those being recorded, even when it takes place in a public space, violates Maryland law.<BR>
3) Be safe. Do not block exits, stairways or otherwise obstruct the flow of traffic. Thousands of users enter libraries on campus every day, and their safety is paramount.</P>

<P><EM>Filming</EM>. Approval to film on university property for commercial or non-news purposes must be obtained prior to the onset of filming. A minimum of 10 business days is required to properly consider any request. Approval is granted through the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>Office of University Communications</FONT></U>, by submitting a film request application. An application and explanation of the procedures and process may be found on the <U><FONT COLOR=blue>University of Maryland Communications website</FONT></U>. News related interviews with University of Maryland faculty or staff do not require a Film Agreement, and no filming fee will be charged. However, interviews must be coordinated with a Media Relations Associate in the Office of University Communications.  Please call (301) 405-4621 for more information. </P>
