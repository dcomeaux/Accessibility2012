	  <H3>Assistance from staff</H3>	  
	    <P>Staff of the UM Libraries are happy to provide additional services for the  research and personal information needs of its patrons with disabilities.  Service Plus Information and Research Services staff will assist with the use  of the catalog, as well as periodical indexes and reference materials. One  large screen workstation in the McKeldin Library first floor public Electronic  Research area is wheelchair-accessible.</P>
	      <P>Before beginning in-depth research, patrons with disabilities should contact  a <U><FONT COLOR=blue>librarian subject specialist</FONT></U> to ensure uninterrupted assistance. An individual with a visual  impairment is expected to bring a reader/assistant if extensive use of  resources is anticipated.</P>
		  <H3>Retrieving, checking out, and renewing materials</H3>
	      <P>If your disability limits your ability to retrieve materials from the book  stacks, it is recommended that you bring an assistant with you. Assistance in  retrieving books will be provided by circulation staff as time and staff  permit.</P>
	      <P>Upon request, the library will issue a special sticker to students with  disabilities that will allow a personal attendant or reader to check out and  renew materials for the student without the student having to come to the  Libraries. To qualify, the student must have certification from Disabled Student Services (301-314-7682; TTY-301-314-7682).</P>
		  <H3>Contact us</H3>
