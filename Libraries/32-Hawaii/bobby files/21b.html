<U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>Aloha
Hawaii Scrapbook</EM></FONT></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
collection of black and white photographs of scenic sites and
identifiable landmarks in Hawaii, programs, tickets, etc. Scrapbook was
compiled by Norma Stewart circa. 1935. It was acquired by or donated to
the University of Hawaii Library Hawaiian Collection.

Digitized reports and debates from the late 19th and early 20th
centuries related to the overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom and the
annexation of Hawai'i. Including the Blount Report and the
Anti-annexation Petitions.

<BR>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>Asia
At Work - Images from Books</EM></FONT></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within
the vast body of literature on Asia held by the Asia Collection at the
University of Hawaii are fascinating illustrations of the people of

<U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>Bob
Krauss Research Index</EM></FONT></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2006 the Hawaiian Collection received the private research index
created by the late Bob Krauss, longtime columnist for the Honolulu
Advertiser and commentator on cultural, social, historical, and
political developments in Hawaii. The index is by no means
comprehensive in subject or time coverage. It largely reflects Krauss's
research interests. Nonetheless it provides critical starting points
into Hawaii's newspaper literature, covering periods of time and
subjects in newspaper titles that have been formally indexed nowhere
else. Transcription of the index is underway as of spring 2007.
<BR>
<BR>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>Chaplain
Hiro Higuchi Correspondence</EM></FONT></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
World War II, Hiro Higuchi of Hawaii volunteered to serve as one of two
chaplains attached to the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, an all-Japanese
American unit formed in January 1943. While serving with the 442nd RCT,
Chaplain Higuchi wrote frequent letters to his wife Hisako reassuring
her of his safety and documenting his experiences and impressions of
the war. His descriptive letters provide insight into the mindset and
experiences of the soldiers of the 442nd RCT and the nature of military
life in World War II.

<BR>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>Creating
Siapo: American Samoa 1967</EM></FONT></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A

slides were donated by Ms. Griffis to the University of Hawaii-Manoa
Library's Pacific Collection in 2009. The eighteen slides in this
online collection depict the process of making siapo, as bark-cloth is
known in Samoa. The slides were donated by Ms. Griffis to the Pacific
Collection in 2009, in conjunction with another major gift to the
University of Hawaii Library: A full-size siapo piece made by Mary
Pritchard, one of world's preeminent makers of traditional bark-cloth,
and the person most often credited for reviving the nearly lost art in
Samoa.

Huan Hua Chinese Picture Story Books</EM></FONT></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lian Huan Hua literarily means "linked serial pictures." They are
pocket sized picture-story books first published by a Shanghai
publisher in the 1920s. Lian huan hua is also commonly known as Xiao
ren shu, children's book for their simplicity and heraldic subjects. In
the early 1920s, lian huan hua first appeared mainly as adaptations of
Jingju (Peking Opera) and Chinese literary classics. The pictures were
created mostly in line drawings, sketches, and oil-wash painting. After
the People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949, lain huan hua
became an extremely popular art form and was used to popularize new
government policies and regulations. From 1951 to 1956, more than
10,000 titles, and approximately 26 billion copies were published in
China.

Sightings/Citings</EM></FONT></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Online project created at The Center for Teaching Excellence, funded by
an Educational Improvement Fund (EIF) grant from the Office of the
President of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. The project focuses on
a specific period of time in the history of Hawai'i - the early
Territorial period, from 1898 - 1933. We located primary sources,
textual and graphic, which can be integrated into a teaching manual.
The goal is to raise questions and engender in the users/viewers of the
materials a desire to take seriously the challenge to recover and
rediscover the history of this place. <BR>

of the United States Trust Territories Administration. Between 1949 and
1954, she worked on or visited a number of locations in the Marshall,
Mariana, and Caroline Islands, as well as in Hawaii. Her photographs

status.

<BR>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>Nuclear
Diaspora: Bikini and Enewetak</EM></FONT></U>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The United States conducted more than eighty nuclear weapons tests on

and 1958. The 878 images in this collection span the years from
1946-1988,
and document the lives of Bikini and Enewetak islanders after they were
relocated from their home islands as a result of these tests. The
images
derive from the anthropological fieldwork of Dr. Leonard "Leni" Mason
and Dr. Robert Kiste, both of whom served as longtime faculty members
at
the University of Hawaii-Manoa prior to their retirement from fulltime
teaching (Mason in 1969 and Kiste in 2002).
