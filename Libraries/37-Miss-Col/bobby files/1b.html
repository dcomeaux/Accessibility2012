					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Noise in Ellis Library Stairwells</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P>Thank you for this observation. We will keep this comment on file if we decide to update our quiet policy. Right now we have three completely quiet areas in Ellis Library: the CPPR room on the 1st floor, which has computers, and the two reading rooms (201 and 202) on the 2nd floor. We also ask that students observe a general level of quiet on floors 2-4, but at this time we don’t feel like we can monitor the stairwells too. We do have security guards (the people with the black uniforms) that walk through the library throughout the day to enforce the quiet policies. But if there is a particular disturbance going on, please feel free to let the security staff at the west or north entrance know about the problem. Thanks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>Quite areas are infested with students on cell phones, chatty groups, and an overwhelming level of noise distractions.  While I understand it is imposible to cut out all noise from these areas, I think it would be easy to address by making quite areas begin at the bottom of the stair-well.  Students think it&#8217;s o.k. to have phone conversations in the stairway, but their voices carry into the rooms quite easily.  If the quiet area extended to the stairwells there would be a higher level of ambiance in these sections.  The current state is really quite annoying and distracting.  I think by changing this policy it will have a positive overall effect and increase awareness.  Please get back to me!</EM></P>

					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Suggestion for &#8220;Find a Specific Article&#8221;</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P><EM>Please add searching by author to the Find a Specific Article page. Thanks.</EM></P>
<P>With the Find a Specific Article function, the data used to make a direct link to an article is the journal title or ISSN, volume number, issue number, start page of the article and the year it was published.  Due to the difficulties in providing correct author information (misspellings, incorrect name, multiple articles by the same author, etc.), it can make it more difficult to successfully link to an article.  The libraries offer other tools to identify articles by author, including searching Summon &lt;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>http://missouri.summon.serialssolutions.com</FONT></U>&gt; or one of the subject databases &lt;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/search/databases/subject.aspx</FONT></U>&gt;.</P>

					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Noisy Patron in Quiet Area</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P><EM>I&#8217;m sitting in the quiet computer areas right now, and I have been here for the last two weeks everyday. There&#8217;s a chinese girl who wears red backpack, and talk very loud everytime when I see her. Just a minutes ago, I have asked her directly to lower her voice, but she kept talking on the phone for a while in very loud voice. </EM></P>
<P><EM>She seems like to come this area everyday, and I have been very disturbed by her irrational acting so many times. Tow days ago, her phone rang about ten times in this area, and everyone just made their face but didn&#8217;t tell her anything. </EM></P>
<P><EM>I think there should be a security or even a part time worker to make sure this is a &#8220;Quiet Area.&#8221; The notes on every computer saying that &#8220;security will ask violators to leave the area&#8221; looks very funny to me, since I see the violator everyday.</EM></P>
<P>Thank you for alerting us to this problem. The quiet computer area is actually a computer lab that is run by DoIT. Most of the time they have a student working in that area. But on the weekends when there is not a DoIT staff person present, you may contact the Ellis Library security guard who sits as the desk at the north entrance of the building.</P>
<P>If Security receive repeated complaints about a person, that person will be asked to stay out of the quiet area.</P>
<P>Our Security guards do walk throughout the building during the day, but they cannot be in all places at once. Please feel free to alert our staff whenever someone is not following our quiet policies. Thanks.</P>

					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library App</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P><EM>I like the Merlin option of texting a call number to your phone, but it would be GREAT if you guys had a smartphone app for streamlined database searches and even cooler if it included a library map with a book locator!  Just a thought.</EM><BR>
Thanks for the suggestion. We do have a mobile website that I hope you find useful. There are also a few databases that have apps available. You can find the list of databases with mobile websites and apps here: <U><FONT COLOR=blue>http://libraryguides.missouri.edu/mobiledatabases</FONT></U>.</P>

					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Laptop Problem</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P><EM>For a class, I was required to use a CDROM disc program on a Windows computer. When I asked how I could do that at Ellis Library, they said I could rent out a laptop, so I did. I asked about getting a charger, and he said it would last the two hours that I had the laptop rented. It did not. The computer battery shut down, and I lost the entire project I was working on because when it shut down it automatically logged me out. I had to start completely over on the project, losing more than an hours worth of work. I am a graduate student, and every hour of study time is precious. I am extremely frustrated that the library did not provide more assistance for my problem.</EM></P>
<P>We do not have chargers to check out for use with the regular laptops. We make sure each computer is fully charged before we will check it out, and the batteries are supposed to last at least two hours. We are sorry that this happened.  They are heavily used and rechargeable batteries don&#8217;t last forever in spite of the great advertising. Thanks for letting us know there is a problem. But it would be helpful to know exactly which laptop you were using, so we can replace the battery. Please stop by the Circulation desk if you have a chance, so we can remedy this problem.</P>

					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library Fines</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P><EM>I have a suggestion about library fines. I love libraries, and I understand the necessity for fines&#8211;to discourage stealing books and so students return them in a timely manner&#8211;but the fees here are OUTRAGEOUS. I understand that I&#8217;m supposed to be a responsible adult and manage due dates on my own without e-mail reminders, but I think it&#8217;s kind of underhanded to wait 5 days before sending an overdue notice to students. My parents do not pay for charges to my student account and as a graduate student I live below the poverty level. I am sure there are many other students in the same condition. I would like to suggest that you remove fees from the student&#8217;s account after they have returned the books, or at least minimize them to a reasonable amount (such as $2 per week, instead of $2 or $10 per day). I suppose you probably make a decent amount of your money from library fees but my experience so far this semester has made me not even want to check out books from the library.</EM></P>
<P>Thank you for your comment. In most cases, we do not charge fines on materials. If a book is overdue more than 5 days, you will receive a notice from us stating that you will be billed $175 for the replacement of the book if you do not return it. Once you do return the book, that replacement cost is removed from your bill. We do charge fines for recalled books, and sometime for books borrowed from other libraries depending on their policies. For all the details about our fine policies, please visit http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/about/borrow/fees.htm.</P>
<P>If you have additional questions about fines call (573) 882-4072 or your <U><FONT COLOR=blue>branch library</FONT></U>.</P>

					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Podcasts</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P><EM>Would the library consider creating podcasts of library events such as the Banned Books Week Lecture and the Open Access Lecture and Panel Discussion for staff and students who are unable to attend them?</EM></P>
<P>Many of our events are videotaped and will be made available in the online digital repository, <U><FONT COLOR=blue>MOspace.</FONT></U> But it would probably be possible for us to create a page on our website that links to all of these events. Thank you for the suggestion.<EM><BR>

					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Complaint About Noise in Ellis Library</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P><EM>I completed my undergraduate degree in another state but came to MU to begin my graduate studies.  Ellis Library is a wonderful facility&#8230;but to consider it a learning facility is almost a joke at times.  Do people not know that you&#8217;re supposed to be quiet in a library?  That doesn&#8217;t mean absolutely no talking or any sort of noise&#8230;but it&#8217;s ridiculous when people (many people on many occasions) talk for extended periods of time in their regular tone/volume, and not even about anything urgent!  I just left and am going to attempt to do work in the student commons (which is actually much quieter than Ellis&#8230;which shouldn&#8217;t be the case) because multiple people felt that it was acceptable/normal to pick up their phones and talk about weekend plans or how hung over they were with no recognition of the fact that people around them were trying to do work and most had to wear earphones to block them out.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Library staff should walk around and stop this sort of disruptive, disgusting behavior.  Yes, I mean disgusting.  People shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to put their bare feet on the tables or curse loudly about their professors on the phone.  It sets a terrible image for the school and the caliber of students.  Of all the times I&#8217;ve been in the library, there has only been one instance when someone dared to speak up&#8230;others are probably terrified they&#8217;ll get the self-justifying death glare from those who can&#8217;t even bother to get a study room to brag about weekend conquests, relationship issues, and complain about how their professors are @#*(&amp;@$&#8217;s.</EM></P>
<P>We are sorry to that you were unable to study in Ellis Library due to noise. We do have different levels of noise control in Ellis Library. The first floor of Ellis, except for the Current Periodicals Room, is not a quiet study area. In this area, students are allowed to study in groups, use their cell phones and work with library staff on research. All other areas of the library are kept quiet to varying degrees. You can find a complete list of quiet study areas<U><FONT COLOR=blue> here.</FONT></U></P>
<P>Please contact a security officer (they are the ones in black shirts and pants), if you are in a quiet area and others are being disruptive.</P>

					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Picking Up a Book for Someone Else</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P><EM>I would like to know why I can&#8217;t pick up a book for my wife, who is a student and not on campus. I am a faculty member for God&#8217;s sake, what do you think I am going to steal the book? Rediculous!</EM></P>
<P>We actually can usually accommodate patrons who need something picked up for them. Please contact the Circulation/Reserve Desk in advance. The number is 882-3362. <EM></EM></P>

					<H2><U><FONT COLOR=blue>Suggestion on Notifying Library Staff About Noise</FONT></U></H2>
					<P><EM>by</EM> admin</P>
					
<P><EM>As indicated by many of the previous suggestions, there is a noise problem in some areas of the library that should be quiet study areas. I&#8217;ve thought this a number of times myself, and I think it would be awesome if there were some way to remotely and anonymously notify security or library staff of noisy groups upstairs via the libraries website or a text message. I think that the simple act of advertising such a system with signs in the study rooms would serve to cut down on the problem considerably.</EM></P>
<P>Thank you for that suggestion. I have passed it along to our Security Staff.<EM><BR>
