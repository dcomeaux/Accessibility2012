<H3>TIPS FOR STARTING YOUR SEARCH</H3>
<H4>Before You Begin Searching</H4>
<P>The Undergraduate Library has a series of excellent 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>guides to the
research process</FONT></U>, including this 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>
<EM>Types of Databases</EM>
</FONT></U> guide, which offers suggestions for selecting databases and finding articles.</P>
<P>If you are looking for articles in a particular academic discipline, many of the University
Library's 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>departmental library websites</FONT></U> have 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>subject guides</FONT></U> with
recommended databases. For instance, here is a 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>subject guide on
education</FONT></U> from the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Education and Social
Sciences Library</FONT></U>, and here is 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>one on agriculture</FONT></U>
from the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Funk ACES Library</FONT></U>.</P>
<P>If you need help on selecting a database to use for finding articles, please 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>
<EM>Ask A Librarian</EM>
</FONT></U> ! We'll be happy to offer advice based on your research needs.</P>
</FONT></U> 
<H3>USE THE EASY SEARCH TOOL</H3>
<H4>First: Try Easy Search</H4>
<P>One way to find information and articles on a topic is to search the library's databases and
journals.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>To do this, go to the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Main Library's homepage</FONT></U> and type
your topic into the "Easy Search" box. You can also choose a subject area to include in your search
using the drop-down menu. An "Advanced Search" will allow you to choose and search more than one
subject area at a time.</P>
<P>
[easy search]
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>The results page contains a lot of information and can be overwhelming. First, check the top
box. For popular topics, there may be a link to straight to a Library Subject Guide. Library
Subject Guides are pages that librarians have put together containing links, information, and
resources on a particular topic.</P>
<P>
[libguide link]
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>The rest of this page breaks your search results down based on what type of resource they are.
The top section contains links to journals, articles, and abstracts that use the keywords you
searched.</P>
<P>
[search results]
</P>
<P>The following section links to books in Illinois’ catalog and e-books. The last section contains
Google and Google Scholar results that use your key words. Feel free to browse each section in your
pursuit for more information.</P>
<P>
[search results continued]
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>To look at some of the specific articles your search found, choose any one of the links from the
Journal and Magazine Articles section at the top of the results page. The matches listed to the
right include articles that have your search words anywhere in the article. For this search on gun
control, “gun” could be at the beginning of the article only and “control” could be at the end. The
phrase results, on the other hand, only include articles that have both words together as you typed
them.</P>
<P>For this search, choose the phrase matches found in 
<EM>Academic Search Premier PLUS (Ebsco)</EM>.</P>
<P>
[phrase matches]
</P>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> If you are not using a campus computer, you will have to login to see any
search results. You will be asked for your NetID and Active Directory password. If you have
forgotten what either of these are, visit the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Cites Password
Manager</FONT></U>.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Notice that your search terms have been entered automatically into the search box and quotations
have been added to them to indicate that you are searching for phrase matches. Putting quotations
around a phrase tells the database to search for those words next to each other.</P>
<P>Each database is different but most will allow you to both skim the list of articles found and
to narrow your results further using keywords and more searching.</P>
<P>
[search the database]
</P>
<P>For example, if you just want to find information on gun control in England, you can add England
to the search terms and search again to narrow the results. You can also limit the type of
publication, year, language, and more using the menus on the left side of the screen.</P>
<P>Many articles will have a pdf or html full text version available. If available, there will be a
link to it in the description of each article.</P>
<P>
[limit the search]
</P>
</LI>
</OL>
</FONT></U> 
<H3>USE THE ONLINE JOURNALS, NEWSPAPERS, &amp; DATABASES TOOL</H3>
<H4>Second: Try a subject search using the Online Journals, Newspapers, &amp; Databases tool</H4>
<P>Another way to narrow your search is to find and explore specific journals that are relevant to
your topic.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>To do this, go to the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Online Journals, Newspapers, &amp; Databases
tool</FONT></U> found on the Main Library's homepage.</P>
<P>
[go to online journals tool]
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Choose the "Subject" tab at the top of the page. Scroll through the broad subjects on the left
side of the page and choose the one your topic best fits under. The primary limitation of this tool
is that you can only choose one subject at a time to search.</P>
<P>For the topic of "gun control" choose the "Law" subject.</P>
<P>
[subject tab]
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Once you have clicked on a subject, a list of subcategories will appear in the right box. Choose
the one that best describes your topic. To choose more than one hold down the "control" button on
your keyboard as you click on each subcategory.</P>
<P>For this search, choose the "Crime, Criminology, and Law Enforcement" subcategory. Click "Go" to
search your terms.</P>
<P>
[subcategory]
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>This search will pull up a list of journals that have all been labeled with the subject and
subcategory you chose. Browse through these to find one or more that sound like they may have
relevant information.</P>
<P>The journal 
<EM>Accident Analysis and Prevention</EM> sounds like it might have articles about gun control and
so may be a good place to start your search. Under the title of the journal, notice that different
databases that cover different dates are listed. For example, 
<EM>Elsevier ScienceDirect Complete</EM> contains issues of the publication from 1969 while 
<EM>Elesvier SD Backfile Medicine and Dentistry</EM> only contains issues from 1969-1994. Choose
the database that matches the dates you need.</P>
<P>For this search, choose 
<EM>Elsevier ScienceDirect Complete</EM> because it covers the widest range of dates.</P>
<P>
[journal search results]
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>You will be taken to a Discover pop-up window. Choose "Go" to continue to the publication.</P>
<P>
[discover pop-up window]
</P>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> This is another place in your search where you may be asked to login if you
are not using a campus computer. Do so using your NetID and Active Directory password. If you have
forgotten either of these, visit the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Cites Password
Manager</FONT></U>.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Every journal, database, and publication has a different interface but most have similar
features. From this main page of the 
<EM>Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention</EM> journal, you can read through old volulmes, search key
terms in the journal, download pdf versions of the articles, and even export article citations for
use in citation management software.</P>
<P>
[browse by subject]
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Repeat the search just demonstrated using the Online Journals, Newspapers, &amp; Databases tool
to find and browse through other relevant journals. This is a good strategy for gathering
information and articles on a given topic.</P>
