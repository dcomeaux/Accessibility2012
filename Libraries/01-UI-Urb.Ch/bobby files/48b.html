<H2>Library Initiatives</H2>
<P>The University Library is involved in a variety of interesting and exciting projects that
reflect the breadth and depth of information resources provided to our users. Even as we move to a
highly digitized environment, we are cognizant of our rich tradition as one of the preeminent
research libraries in the world. The projects listed on this page reflect the many aspects of
information and knowledge production and delivery in which we are involved. Please come and explore
these with us!</P>

<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library IT News</FONT></U>
<BR>Want to know what news IT projects are in the offing, or even being discussed? Take a look at
this blog, and feel free to contribute to it. Can't find what your looking for? Just post your
question or concern here. All Library IT members subscribe to this blog (along with many other
people) and the best bits are routinely gathered up and republished on the library lib-news
list-serv. Any Library employee can post messages or comments here.</LI>

<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library Labs</FONT></U>
<BR>This area is home for some of the library's beta web resources and services. These resources
have made it past the R&amp;D phase, and are ready for people to evaluate. You'll find information
about the library browser toolbar (libX) here, search plugins, bookmarklets, and Greasemonkey
scripts.</LI>

<U><FONT COLOR=blue>New Service Model Programs</FONT></U>
<BR>
<P>Based on a synthesis of ideas from the Library faculty and staff, strategic priorities and input
from the campus community, the New Service Model (NSM) Program involves nearly two dozen projects
to be pursued over the next few years, as articulated in 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>"Library Services for the 21st Century at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: Final Report and Recommendations of the Budget Group
Plus" (April 21, 2008)</FONT></U>.</P>

<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Learning Commons</FONT></U> 
<P>The Learning Commons initiative is building upon the success the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Undergraduate Library</FONT></U> has had over the
past 40 years as the central hub of undergraduate research and learning on the University of
Illinois campus. The Commons encourages engagement with information in its various forms,
reinforces the value of collaborative inquiry, creates new opportunities for community interaction,
and supports students to adjust to and succeed at the University of Illinois.</P></LI>
<LI>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>IDEALS</FONT></U> 
<P>collects, disseminates, and provides persistent and reliable access to the research and
scholarship of faculty, staff, and students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Faculty, staff, and graduate students can deposit their research and scholarship - unpublished and,
in many cases, published - directly into IDEALS. IDEALS includes research papers, technical
reports, published papers, pre-prints, conference papers and presentations, datasets, and other
digital research material.

<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Illinois Harvest</FONT></U> 
<P>Illinois Harvest is a free public gateway combining search, aggregation, and discovery services.
We provide organized and thematic access to digitized and born-digital resources about Illinois,
created by Illinois scholars, or included among the digital collections of The University of
Illinois Library. The goal of the Illinois Harvest/Large-scale Digitization Initiative is to
broaden our digital collections and to enhance access to those collections, as well as to
complementary digital resources elsewhere.</P></LI>
<LI>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Digital Projects</FONT></U> 
<P>The UIUC Library and its departmental libraries conduct a broad range of digital projects,
including the digitization of library collections and archives, research in information retrieval
technologies for digital collections, and digital library research projects. They also develop
instructional resources and facilitating tools for digitization projects, and experiment with the
application of digital content in teaching and learning.</P></LI>
<LI>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Gaming Collection</FONT></U> 
<P>The Gaming collection was created to support a wide variety of campus interdisciplinary
programs, scholarly research, and student needs involving video games. The collection supports
disciplines such as psychology, speech communications, computer science, information science,
literature, and others which are investigating the technology, game world structure, narratives,
and social interactions generated by the video game phenomenon.</P></LI>
<LI>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Soybean Press</FONT></U> 
<P>is the cooperative effort of The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, The Graduate School of
Library and Information Science, The University of Illinois Press, Facilities and Services Printing
Department, and the School of Art and Design. The Press' goal is to expand the awareness and
knowledge of fine press books with particular emphasis on the teaching and promotion of letterpress
printing. In preserving this traditional means of book production, It's aim is to craft beautifully
printed texts and to inspire an appreciation of the book-from its physical design and manufacture
to its intellectual content-in students and faculty across campus and in the broader community of
our region.</P></LI>
