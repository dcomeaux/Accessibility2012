<HR>
<H3>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Online Library Catalog</FONT></U>
</H3>
<P>You can easily access the online library catalog, which contains records for items at Illinois
from your home or office. By placing an online request, you can have books mailed directly to your
office. Books can be checked out for sixteen weeks and renewed online or by telephone at
217-333-8400. The library has developed online tutorials to help you 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>find materials</FONT></U>.</P>
<H3>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Online Research
Resources</FONT></U>
</H3>
<P>You can also easily access online materials from home, including your favorite professional
journals. By entering the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>proxy server</FONT></U> through the
ORR, you will be recognized as affiliated with the University. Many databases now provide full-text
materials, and there are instructions available on how to 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>find a specific
article</FONT></U>.</P>
<H3>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan Services</FONT></U>
</H3>
<P>Can't find it on campus or in I-Share Online? A world of other opportunities exists through
Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery. Online forms are provided to request research materials
that are not available through I-Share Online. Instructions are available on how to 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>locate materials not available at
Illinois</FONT></U>.</P>
<H4>Illinois Doc Express Service</H4>
<P>Tired of going from place to place to photocopy materials? Try the low-cost, on-campus 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Illinois Doc Express Service</FONT></U>. The 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan and Document
Delivery</FONT></U> department provides a convenient fee-based photocopy service at $3.00 per article for
journal articles located on the University of Illinois campus. Documents are supplied within 48
hours of request, and payment is taken through a departmental account or credit card. Don't forget
that a large body of materials is also available online in full-text.&nbsp;</P>
<H3>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Information and Reference
Services</FONT></U>
</H3>
<P>Located on the second floor of the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Main Library</FONT></U>, the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Reference,
Research and Government Information Services Desk</FONT></U> (217-333-2290) provides directional
assistance, gives information and instruction on electronic resources, and answers quick reference
questions. Reference librarians are available at the Information Desk and the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>departmental
libraries</FONT></U> to provide research assistance and help you navigate the Library's electronic
resources and the Internet. You also can tap into information and reference services through 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>email</FONT></U> or live text chat through
our 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Ask a Librarian</FONT></U> service.</P>
<H3>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Placing Materials on Reserve</FONT></U>
</H3>
<P>Many departmental libraries maintain reserve collections for their patrons. Please contact the
staff at the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>departmental library</FONT></U> where you wish your materials to reside to
place print materials on reserve.
<BR>
<BR>All electronic reserves are processed by the Information Processing &amp; Management unit of
the University Library. Additional information for faculty/instructors can be found online in our 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>E-Reserve FAQ</FONT></U>. Forms and
procedures for placing materials on reserve are

person at any circulation desk.</P>
<H4>Do you need faculty authorization cards for your assistants?</H4>
<P>To obtain 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>authorization</FONT></U>, the faculty member
and graduate student must complete and sign a "Proxy Form" available in the Main Circulation Desk,
2nd floor, Main Library. The application form requires both the faculty or graduate student's and
proxy's identification numbers and signatures. Check out the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>FAQ</FONT></U> for questions about
proxy authorization.</P>
<H4>Do undergraduate students need a pass to use the Main Stacks?</H4>
<P>Illinois undergraduate students should 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>request a Bookstacks pass</FONT></U> at the Main
Circulation Desk, 2nd floor, Main Library.</P>
<H4>Do you need to recall library materials?</H4>
<P>While 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>borrowers cannot initiate recalls
online</FONT></U>, they may request to have an item recalled from another borrower by inquiring at any
library public service point or by calling the Library Telephone Center at 217-333-8400. Library
staff can only recall a University of Illinois item from another borrower if there are no other
available copies anywhere in the statewide online catalog. Items owned by other I-Share Libraries
cannot be recalled without prior permission of the owning library.</P>
