		<H1>Illinois History and Lincoln Collections</H1>
<H2>(Illinois Historical Survey and Lincoln Room)</H2>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hours: M-F, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
<BR>Phone: (217) 333-1777
<BR>Email: ihlc@library.illinois.edu
<BR>Address: 322 Library, 1408 W. Gregory Dr., Urbana, IL 61801</P>
<P>The unit is staffed by John Hoffmann and Ryan Ross.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<HR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>ACCESS</H2>
<P>The reading room of the unit is located in Library 322.
<BR>
<BR> 
<EM>Printed materials</EM> in the collections are cataloged in the Library's 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>online catalog</FONT></U>.&nbsp; These materials, which
users may browse, are shelved in an adjacent section of the main stacks.
<BR>
<BR> 
<EM>Manuscript collections</EM> are stored in the main stacks but are retrieved for research use in
Library 322. The unit's manuscript holdings are listed, and partly described, in a 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>searchable database</FONT></U>.</P>
<P>Some collections are fully inventoried and entered into the current database. Other collections
have been inventoried, in whole or in part; typescripts or printouts of those inventories are
available upon request.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>SCOPE</H2>
<P>The collections contain approximately 25,000 volumes, 2,000 cubic feet of
manuscripts, and a large number of maps, broadsides, prints and photographs, artifacts, and
ephemera.&nbsp; Researchers benefit substantially from the advice and suggestions of a staff which
is familiar with these materials, with their inner connections, and with Illinois history and
Lincoln studies as a whole.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>
<P>For many years, the collections were located in two separate units, the Illinois Historical
Survey and the Lincoln Room, each with a history of its own.
<BR>
<BR>The University created the Survey in 1909, and for three decades it functioned as the
editorial office of the Illinois State Historical Library in Springfield.&nbsp; It mainly collected
materials of use in the preparation of the Centennial History of Illinois, a multi-volume study,
and the Illinois Historical Collections, a documentary series.&nbsp; These publications, written or
edited by University faculty, essentially created the field of Illinois history.&nbsp; (This
accomplishment is commemorated by the bronze plaque that stands at the north entrance to the
Library.)
<BR>
<BR>After 1939, when the state historical agency was consolidated in Springfield, the Survey
became fully a unit of the Graduate College.&nbsp; As such, it continued to expand its holdings in
the field of Illinois history and to define the study of the state's past.
<BR>
<BR>In 1966, the unit was moved from Lincoln Hall, where it was affiliated with the Department of
History, to the Library, where, by serving an increasing number of users from many departments, it
grew into a distinctly interdisciplinary "departmental library."
<BR>
<BR>In 1980, the Survey became an administrative part of the Library under terms of an Agreement
with the Graduate College whereby the Library promised the independence and integrity of the
Survey.
<BR>
<BR>In 1951, the collection which formed the nucleus of the Lincoln Room was donated to the
University by Harlan Hoyt Horner and Henrietta Calhoun Horner, both graduates and both Lincoln
scholars.&nbsp; The Horners also established an endowment to enlarge the holdings of the Lincoln
Room and to maintain it as a separate, distinct part of the Library.
<BR>
<BR>The collections of the Lincoln Room and the Survey, being so closely related, were combined
in 2001.&nbsp; The librarian and curator of the Survey, who advocated this combination, became also
the librarian and curator of the Lincoln Room. For many topics, the combination of the two units
significantly enhanced the research value of the separate holdings.</P>
<P>The reading room of the Illinois History and Lincoln Collections, once in Library 346, was moved
in 2006 to Library 422, and moved again in 2009 to its present location, Library 322.</P>
