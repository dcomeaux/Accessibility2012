<EM>bike racks</EM> for the north and south sides of its plaza.&nbsp; Students are already
using two bike racks already installed on the east and west side of the plaza; however, they have
become so popular that space is limited.&nbsp; Additional bike racks will deter students from
locking their bikes to the plaza’s railing overlooking the Undergraduate Library’s courtyard.</P>

<EM>
<EM>International Encyclopedia of Education, 3rd edition</EM>
