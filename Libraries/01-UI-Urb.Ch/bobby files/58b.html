  <P ALIGN="left">Rare Books</P>
  
  <P>The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library welcomes scholars from around the world in their use or inquiries about the collection of rare books at the University of Illinois. The collection represents the entire range of printed material in the West, and extends from more than 1,100 incunables (books printed before 1501), to twenty&#8211;first century fine press publications. Over the decades a number of strengths in the collection have emerged due to the efforts of local scholars and librarians in several fields of study. The Shakespeare and Milton collections were founded as the result of the labors of Professors T. W. Baldwin and Harris F. Fletcher, respectively. The investigations of Marvin Herrick in sixteenth century Italian drama, Henri Stegemeier in emblem books and A. V. Carozzi in the history of geology have fostered the collections and resulted in separate, published catalogs of the holdings.</P>
  
  <P>The rare book collection represents virtually every discipline on campus and, in conjunction with the wide array of special collections in the library, is available to interested students and scholars both locally and around the world. The general collection consists of approximately 200,000 volumes. In addition, there are a number of thematic or author&#8211;based book collections either maintained within the general rare book collection or established as named special collections. Some of the more important of these are described below.</P>    
    
  <P>Access to rare books is best gained via the UIUC online catalog (see links on top banner of this page), although this does not yet contain a complete record of all holdings. An old in&#8211;library card catalog (also available in printed form) is of substantial use to supplement the online catalog. Finding aids also describe many individual parts of the collection: these are noted in the descriptions below. Reference questions concerning the rare book collection may be submitted through an <U><FONT COLOR=blue>online form</FONT></U> (or see our &#8220;<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Reference Help</FONT></U>&#8221; web page.)</P>
  <P>Please refer to our document; <U><FONT COLOR=blue>&quot;General Policies Governing Materials under the Care of The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library,&quot;</FONT></U> for additional information regarding the collection of rare books for The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. </P>

  <P> ASIAN COLLECTION, 886+ vols.</FONT></U></P>

  <P>The Asian Collection 
  consists of material dating from the 14th to the 20th 
  centuries. The great majority of items are Japanese books printed between the 
  17th and 19th centuries, but there is also a small number 
  of Chinese books, as well as three Burmese Kammavaca (Buddhist prayer books); 
  besides books, several maps and scrolls are present.&nbsp;  A large 
  portion of the Asian Collection came from the library of Joseph K. Yamagiwa 
  (1906-1968), a leading scholar and professor of Japanese at the University of Michigan. 
  Professor Yamagiwa's collection, purchased in 1969, contained 1800 volumes, 
  divided 
  between the Asian Library and the Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</P>
  <P>The Asian 
  Collection can be accessed through a card catalog in the Rare Book &amp; 
  Manuscript Library.&nbsp;There are online catalog records available for many 
  volumes.

  <P>EMBLEM BOOKS COLLECTION, 650+ vols.</FONT></U></P>
  
  <P>Emblem books are a variety of illustrated book, primarily produced in the sixteenth through the eighteenth century. They consist of collections of three&#8211;part compositions, each made up of an illustration, a motto (serving as the title of the piece) and an epigram or other written text. It is not uncommon for there to be additional explanatory sections in prose or verse. A broader interpretation includes many other types of illustrated books, such as emblematized fables, Dance of Death books, and books illustrating triumphs that contain numerous and prominent emblems. The development of the UIUC Emblem Books Collection was due in large part to the efforts of Professor Henri Stegemeier (1912&#8211;2001). The collection was described by Thomas McGeary and N. Frederick Nash in <EM>Emblem Books at the University of Illinois</EM> (Boston: G.K. Hall, 1993). Since then, numerous emblem books have been added to the collection. Because of its special strengths, the collection is the basis for a digitization project.</P>
