		<H1>New Collection of Streaming Videos</H1>
<P>Feb 9, 2012</P>




<P>Faculty, staff, and students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign now have 24/7, online access to 12 discipline-specific video collections, which together include more than 10,000 full-length streaming videos&mdash;all cross-searchable from a single interface.</P>
<P>The University, along with Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Northern Illinois University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago, worked together to make a significant purchase of video content from Alexander Street Press, publisher of online collections for scholarly research, teaching and learning, for their campuses.</P>
<P>The online collections include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>American History in Video</LI>
<LI>Classical Music in Video&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Counseling and Therapy in Video</LI>
<LI>Counseling and Therapy in Video: Volume II</LI>
<LI>Education in Video</LI>
<LI>Ethnographic Video Online</LI>
<LI>Dance in Video</LI>
<LI>Filmmakers Library Online</LI>
<LI>Nursing Education in Video</LI>
<LI>Opera in Video</LI>
<LI>Theatre in Video</LI>
<LI>World History in Video</LI>
</UL>
<P>&ldquo;The University Library had been fielding requests to acquire portions of this collection for some time, so we knew that there was a demand for some of the content. When the opportunity arose for us to work with our partner institutions on a cooperative acquisition, we jumped at the chance, knowing that such cooperation would benefit all four institutions through reduced prices and broader access,&rdquo; said Associate University Librarian for Collections and Assistant Dean of Libraries Tom Teper.</P>
<P>Users from within the University community can view and search transcripts alongside videos in this massive collection and create and share custom clips and playlists&mdash;all from a computer or even a mobile device, including iPhone, iPad, and Android.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Faculty have indicated to me that they prefer the convenience of streaming video for classroom instruction, and that the content of these collections will be very useful for their students,&rdquo; said Social Work/Anthropology/Sociology Librarian Beth Sheehan, &ldquo;The Counseling and Therapy in Video and Ethnographic Video Online collections have been on my acquisitions wishlist for some time. In the short time since the purchase, I have already started using the collections to help faculty members find video clips for lesson plans. This is a great teaching and learning resource.&rdquo;</P>
<P>&ldquo;It is great to have multimedia services through the Library,&rdquo; said Julia Pollack, an Instructional Services graduate assistant at Illinois. &ldquo;This is the most amazing resource the Library has ever purchased access to!&rdquo;</P>
<P>To assist patrons in utilizing these online collections, the University Library has created an Alexander Street Press Video Portal research guide at <U><FONT COLOR=blue>http://go.library.illinois.edu/ASPlibguide</FONT></U>.</P><P>Do you have a story you'd like added to the Library News &amp; Events?
