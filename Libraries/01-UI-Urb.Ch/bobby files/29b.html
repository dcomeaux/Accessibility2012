and Grainger Engineering Library!</H3>
<P>Please note that the forms submitted for the Funk ACES and Grainger Engineering Libraries are
processed by the staff of those libraries, not Information Processing &amp; Management. Therefore,
any questions or problems relating to Funk ACES or Grainger Engineering reserves need to be
directed to the appropriate staff in that location. If you wish your print and media materials on
reserve to reside at any other library not included in this list, please contact the staff at that
library directly.</P>
<P>Webforms cannot be used when submitting physical materials (photocopies for electronic reserve,
or personal copies for book or media reserve. Please submit photocopies at the Undergrad Library or
Central Circulation (Main Library), and personal copies at your preferred reserve location, using
the appropriate PDF or MS Word request form from below.&nbsp; (The staff at those locations also

<H4>Submitting Reserve Request Forms</H4>
<P>Reserve requests may be submitted in one of four ways:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Via the appropriate webform above. Webforms cannot be used when submitting physical materials
(photocopies for electronic reserve, or personal copies for book or media reserve.)</LI>
<LI>The list may be typed (or printed clearly) on the appropriate PDF or MS Word form above and
submitted in person at the Undergraduate Library or Central Circulation (Main Library).&nbsp; Funk
ACES Library forms must be submitted directly at the Funk ACES Library. A bibliography may be
attached to the form, rather than entering all of the citations.</LI>
<LI>Emailed to 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>ipm@library.illinois.edu</FONT></U>. Materials to be held at
Funk ACES Library should be emailed directly to 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>acesreserves@library.illinois.edu</FONT></U>. Materials
to be held at Grainger Engineering Library should be emailed directly to 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>eng-reserve@illinois.edu</FONT></U>. Email cannot be used when
submitting physical materials (photocopies for electronic reserve, or personal copies for book or
media reserve.) Please send a separate email for each category of reserves (e-reserves, books, or
media).</LI>
<LI>The list may be typed (or printed clearly) on the appropriate PDF or MS Word form above and
mailed directly to us at: IPM, Main Library, MC-522.&nbsp; A bibliography may be attached to the
form, rather than entering all of the citations.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Please note that we have no public service desk to meet with you in person, and telephone
requests are not accepted due to the complexity of the information required.</P>
<P>Requests submitted through webforms and email are automatically logged into our online ticketing
system. The system will automatically generate a request received email for all requests, which
includes the date and time the request was received. Please note that requests submitted in person
are generally logged into our online ticketing system the following business day, so the request
received email will indicate when the request was logged, not when it was dropped off.&nbsp; If you
do not receive a request received email, we did not receive your submission.</P>
<P>Reserves for Fall and Spring semesters become active one week before the first day of
classes.&nbsp; Summer reserves become active on the first day of classes.&nbsp; Until then, reserve
lists will not be accessible through the online catalog. Before that date, instructors will be able
see their e-reserve lists through a link sent to them in email when the list was completed, but
will not be able to access the documents.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>
</FONT></U>E-Reserves</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Please provide your full name, e-mail address, campus address, and course and term information
on the E-Reserve Request Form (<U><FONT COLOR=blue>webform</FONT></U>,
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>pdf</FONT></U>, or 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Word)</FONT></U> or
syllabus. All e-reserve materials will be linked to your full name on the website. Also, it is very
important that we be able to contact you about your material in case a question or problem arises.
If your course is team-taught and you would like materials to be cross-posted, please provide the
names of all instructors</LI>
<LI>Please submit readings as early as possible, as material is processed in a first-in first-out
manner. It is never too early for us to start processing e-reserves for subsequent semesters. We
typically receive the majority of requests around the beginning of the semester, which creates a
massive backlog, so we greatly appreciate early submissions.</LI>
<LI>For each photocopied item you wish to place on reserve, you should submit only one clean copy
to the reserve staff. The material will be scanned and made available on-line, so there is no need
for multiple print copies to be placed on reserve. All photocopies will be shipped back to your
departmental office approximately two weeks after we finish processing them.</LI>
<LI>Please completely fill out the E-reserve Request Form, if this information is not clearly
apparent on the photocopy itself.</LI>
<LI>If you prefer, you may submit a copy of your syllabus instead of filling out the bibliographic
portion of the E-Reserve Request Form, as long as the syllabus includes all of the pertinent
information. Please note that you are responsible for providing the photocopies and making sure
that they are clear and legible.</LI>
<LI>Alternately, if you know the material is already available in electronic format publicly on the
WWW or through one of the library's subscription full-text databases, you can give us the URL or
citation information including database and we can link to the pre-existing electronic copy.</LI>
<LI>If you have lecture notes, exams, or other material already an electronic format such as a Word
document, Excel spreadsheet, or PowerPoint presentation, you can send us the file as an attachment
and we can use those directly instead of scanning a photocopy.</LI>
<LI>If you submit photocopies for electronic reserve, it is with the understanding that students
are not simultaneously required to buy a course packet of these same materials. If the course
packet is an optional purchase, however, you are welcome to submit the material for electronic
reserve.</LI>
<LI>In certain cases, when the library determines that the material being placed on reserve exceeds
fair use guidelines, we must apply to the publisher for electronic copyright permission. This is
not something that you need to worry about when you submit your materials. However, sometimes a
publisher will deny electronic copyright permission (fortunately, this is relatively rare). If this
happens, we will notify you and work with you to meet your instructional needs.</LI>
<LI>The practices for electronic reserves document is available on the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Library
Administration page</FONT></U>.</LI>
<LI>Additional information for faculty/instructors can be found online in our 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>E-Reserve FAQ</FONT></U>.</LI>
<LI>Additional information for Academic Outreach faculty/instructors can be found in

<H4>
</FONT></U>Book Reserves</H4>
<UL>
<LI>IPM processes book reserves for either the Undergraduate Library Reserves or Central
Circulation Reserves (Main Library).&nbsp; Funk ACES Library staff process materials to be housed
in the Funk ACES Reserves. Grainger Engineering Library staff process materials to be housed in
the&nbsp;Grainger Engineering Reserves. You must indicate on the reserve form the location at which
you wish the materials to be held.</LI>
<LI>Be sure to list the exact title, author, and edition (if that is important) of each
book--inaccurate listings can cause delays in processing. It is not necessary to include the call
numbers or to bring library books in yourself.</LI>
<LI>If your syllabus contains the correct citation information you can submit a copy of the
syllabus in place of the request form as long as you provide the data regarding contact
information.</LI>
<LI>Reserve requests are processed in the order received. We ask that lists for the next semester
be submitted no later than two weeks before the first day of instruction.</LI>
<LI>Often, we have to recall certain books that have been checked out by another patron, which can
take three weeks or more. If the library does not own a particular book on your list, we will be
happy to order it; however, please note that this process can take up to eight weeks or longer,
especially if the title is out of print. We will notify you of any books that must be recalled or
ordered so that you can plan your assignments accordingly, or perhaps bring in a personal copy of
the book if you own one.</LI>
<LI>You will need to submit a new reserve list each semester that the course is taught, even if the
materials are being carried over from a previous semester. We do keep records of reserve lists
going back to 1998, but resubmitting a new copy of your reserve list each semester safeguards
against potential omissions and delays. However, if you are reusing all of the materials that are
currently on book reserve for your course, an email requesting that they be carried over is
sufficient.</LI>
<LI>Materials which belong to other institutions cannot be placed on reserve, even if they are
charged out to an individual instructor.</LI>
<LI>E-Books may be placed on reserve just as physical books are. When filling out the Book Reserve
Request forms (see above), enter e-book or online resource in the Call Number field.&nbsp; (If the
reserve request is only for e-books, please select Central Circulation or Undergrad Library as the
Location.)</LI>
<LI>Placing Personal Copies on Reserve: You are welcome to submit personal or departmental books
for reserve, either single or multiple copies. We will place call number labels on each item and
magnetic security strips inside. However, please be aware that though the library takes reasonable
precautions to secure your materials, there is a possibility that your personal copies may be
damaged or stolen during the course of the semester, and the library cannot assume liability for
replacing these materials.</LI>

<H4>
</FONT></U>Media Reserves</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Faculty/instructors may wish to place media titles on reserve for a particular course. More
than one course can reserve the same titles during a particular semester. Students will be expected
to view the titles in the library, but instructors may check out materials for classroom showings.
To place media titles on reserve either fill out the information on the Media Item Reserve Request
Form (Get form above) or send an email to the staff at 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>ipm@library.illinois.edu</FONT></U> with the course information,
personal contact information, and titles and call numbers of the items to be placed on reserve.
Please note that placing an item on reserve for a course limits that title to in-house viewing for
students, but other faculty/instructors may still use charge out those items for classroom
use.</LI>
<LI>The 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Undergraduate Library</FONT></U>
Circulation and Reserves Desk handles all media bookings (reservations) to view media materials at
a specific date and time (as opposed to placing the materials on a reserve list).&nbsp; For more
information, click 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>here</FONT></U>.</LI>
<LI>Be sure to list the exact title, director, and edition (if that is important) of each media
item-inaccurate listings can cause delays in processing. It is not necessary to include the call
numbers or to bring library-owned media in yourself.</LI>
<LI>If your syllabus contains the correct citation information you can submit a copy of the
syllabus in place of the request form as long as you provide the data regarding contact
information.</LI>
<LI>Reserve requests are processed in the order received. We ask that lists for the next semester
be submitted no later than two weeks before the first day of instruction.</LI>
<LI>Often, we have to recall certain items that have been checked out by another patron, which can
take a week or more. If the library does not own a particular item on your list, we will be happy
to order it; however, please note that this process can take up to eight weeks or longer,
especially if the title is out of print. We will notify you of any items that must be recalled or
ordered so that you can plan your assignments accordingly, or perhaps bring in a personal copy of
the item if you own one.</LI>
<LI>You will need to submit a new reserve request each semester that the course is taught, even if
the materials are being carried over from a previous semester. We do keep records of reserve lists
going back to 1998, but resubmitting a new copy of your reserve list each semester safeguards
against potential omissions and delays. However, if you are reusing all of the materials that are
currently on media reserve for your course, an email requesting that they be carried over is
sufficient.</LI>
<LI>Materials which belong to other institutions or rental stores cannot be placed on reserve, even
if they are charged out to an individual instructor.</LI>
<LI>
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Streaming media</FONT></U> may be placed on reserve just as physical
media are. When filling out the Media Reserve Request forms (see above), enter streaming or online
resource in the Call Number field.</LI>
<LI>Placing Personal Copies on Reserve: You are welcome to submit personal or departmental media
materials for reserve, either single or multiple copies. We will place call number labels on each
item and magnetic security strips in the case and restrict their use to the library (no overnight
charges). However, please be aware that though the library takes reasonable precautions to secure
your materials, there is a possibility that your personal copies may be damaged or stolen during
the course of the semester, and the library cannot assume liability for replacing these materials.
Please note that the library cannot violate copyright law, so if there is a question about the
validity of a personal copy we may need to clarify before processing for reserves. For more
information about the Guidelines for Off-Taping for Educational Purposes, please see the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Kastenmeier Guidelines</FONT></U>.</LI>
