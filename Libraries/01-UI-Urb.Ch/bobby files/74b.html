</FONT></U>About the Learning Commons
<BR></H3>
<P>The Learning Commons at the Undergraduate Library aims to extend the successful programs and
services of the Undergraduate Library to meet the evolving learning, studying, research, and
content creation needs of the 21^st Century undergraduate student. The Learning Commons at the
Undergraduate Library isn't separate from the Undergraduate Library, but an extension of its core
values, and representation of its philosophical approach to library services &amp; programs
<BR>
<BR>For the past 40 years, the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Undergraduate Library</FONT></U> has been the
central hub of undergraduate research and learning on the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>University of Illinois</FONT></U> Urbana campus. The LC@UGL
is built on the principle that today's students need the library to not only be place where they
can access the information resources they need to do their coursework, but a site that supports
their entire research process, from engaging their curiosity through producing a final intellectual
product-in whatever form they need that final project to take.
<BR>
<BR>How do we do this?</P>
<H3>
<EM>
</FONT></U>Space</EM>
</H3>
<P>The LC @ UGL wants students to be comfortable. We are continuously working to develop &amp;
improve our spaces to match the ways students use them. Our goal is to provide flexible spaces that
accommodate group-work &amp; single study, with spaces for those who need quiet isolation and
spaces where groups can work together.
<BR>
<BR>We have silent study rooms (downstairs) and our 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Collaboratories</FONT></U> provide space and tools for groups
working together on projects and presentations.
<BR>
<BR>We also have specialized areas for working with our 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Partners</FONT></U>, for media editing, for comfortable browsing
of new materials, and for watching films.
<BR>
<BR>We try hard to be responsive to what you want. Is there something you'd like to see us do
with our space? 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Let us know</FONT></U>!</P>
<H3>
<EM>
</FONT></U>Equipment &amp; Technology&nbsp;</EM>
</H3>
<P>
<EM>Computing</EM>: The LC@UGL offers a variety of technology, as flexibly as possible. We
have dozens of 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>PCs</FONT></U>, and 8 Macs loaded for
media editing. We have 18 laptops available for in-library use as well.
<BR>
<BR>We recently began offering public 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>gaming</FONT></U>, with Wii, XBox &amp;
PlayStation consoles &amp; controllers available for use in the UGL (you can check out games from
UGL too!)
<BR>
<BR>We circulate a lot of small 
<EM>technology</EM> as well -- MP3 players, GPS, TI-89 graphing calculators, USB thumb
drives, digital cameras &amp; video cameras, and so much more. 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Check out what you can check
out</FONT></U>!
<BR>
<BR>We also partner with CITES Security Outreach to provide several Laptop Clinics each semester,
where you can bring your equipment in for a check-up
<BR>
<BR>Is there something you'd like us to circulate that don't have? 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Let us know</FONT></U>!</P>
<H3>
<EM>
</FONT></U>Media&nbsp;</EM>
</H3>
<P>The Undergraduate Library hosts the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>media collection</FONT></U> for campus (there's great stuff over at
the Music &amp; performing Arts Library as well!), so for all your media needs, we're here. If
you're looking to explore avant garde movements, the best of Bollywood, study award-winning
cinematography, or just grab something to watch, we have it. Our 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>media viewing booths</FONT></U> hold the equipment you need to
watch - laserdisc players, VCRs, and DVDs all hooked up to televisions for your viewing pleasure
(we also sell earbuds at the Circulation Desk so you can watch without disturbing others)
<BR>
<BR>We also have a significant 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>game collection</FONT></U>, including 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>games, consoles and controllers</FONT></U> for XBox, XBox 360,
PlayStation 2 and 3, Wii, and others.
<BR>
<BR>Want a game we don't have? 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Let us know</FONT></U>!</P>
<H3>
</FONT></U>Digital Display&nbsp;</H3>
<P>The Undergraduate Library highlights a digital image collection on campus and displays it on a
flat screen television located in the Browsing/New Materials section. This 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>digital display</FONT></U> is updated periodically and
showcases different pictures or artwork from the UIUC community, so be sure to check it out!</P>
<H3>
<EM>
</FONT></U>People&nbsp;</EM>
</H3>
<P>The people make the place -- and we have 
<EM>great</EM> people. We work hard to be helpful, to be friendly, and to be knowledgeable. The 70+
people who work in the Learning Commons, and the Undergraduate Library care about making sure you
can find the information or equipment you need. We're here to help!
<BR>
<BR>You can 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>email us, IM us, call us</FONT></U>, 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>drop us a suggestion</FONT></U>, or stop by the Research or
Circulation Desks for assistance - that's why we're here! We're also on 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Twitter</FONT></U> and 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Facebook.</FONT></U>
<BR>
<BR>In addition to the staff of the Undergraduate Library, the Learning Commons is about making
connections. We have campus partners for services &amp; programs designed to meet the needs of
undergraduate students. Some of our partners hold office hours at the Connections Desk (Study
Abroad, General Advising, Resume Critiques from The Career Center), and some are spread throughout
the Learning Commons &amp; Undergraduate Library.
