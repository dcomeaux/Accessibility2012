		<H1>Request a Book Not at Illinois</H1>
<P>When attempting to find books, you can imagine the options available to you as a series of
concentric circles:</P>
<P>
[The universe of books available to Illinois students and staff]
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The basic idea is to start in the center with the Illinois catalog, and then work your way out
until you find what you need. 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Watch a video</FONT></U> on how to locate books at Illinois. Here are the steps:</P>
<H3>1. VERIFYING THAT A BOOK ISN'T AVAILABLE AT ILLINOIS</H3>
<P>If you haven't already done so, the first step is to confirm that Illinois doesn't have a copy
of the book you need. You can do this using the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>online catalog</FONT></U> (see 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>tips on finding
specific books</FONT></U>). 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue></FONT></U></P>
<P>&gt;&gt; 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Watch a video</FONT></U> on how to locate items that are not at Illinois.</P>
<H3>2. REQUESTING A BOOK THROUGH I-SHARE</H3>
<P>If the book you need isn't available at Illinois (it's either checked out, lost, or we just
don't own it), the next step is to check 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>I-Share</FONT></U>, a shared
catalog for 76 academic libraries throughout Illinois (you may also see these libraries referred to
as "ILCSO" or "CARLI"). There are two methods for searching the I-Share catalog:</P>
<H4>Repeating &nbsp;a search from the Illinois catalog</H4>
<P>If you look up a book in the Illinois catalog, you will often find that Illinois owns a copy,
but it's checked out. In these cases, you can expand the search results by clicking the 
<EM>Show all libraries</EM>&nbsp;link under 
<EM>Facets Now Applied</EM>&nbsp;to the right of your search results:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
[Show all libraries]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clicking this link will show you which other libraries in the I-Share catalog own the title, and
whether it's available at any of them.</P>
<P>If your search in the Illinois catalog doesn't turn up anything at all, you can re-run the
search in the I-Share catalog by clicking the 
<EM>Repeat search in the I-Share catalog</EM> link:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
[Repeat Search in I-Share]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Directly searching the I-Share catalog</H4>
<P>You can also search the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>I-Share catalog</FONT></U>
directly. The procedure for searching this catalog is the same as for searching the Illinois VuFind
catalog (see 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>VuFind Searching
Tips</FONT></U>).</P>
<P>
<EM>
</FONT></U>Placing the request</EM>
</P>
<P>Once you've located the book you need, you're ready to place your request.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Verify that a copy is available at one or more libraries:
<BR> 
[Available in I-Share]</LI>
<LI>Click the 
<EM>Request 1st Available</EM> tab:
<BR> 
[Request 1st available]</LI>
<LI>If you are not already logged in to the catalog, log in with your VuFind username and password.
If you haven't created a username and password for the VuFind or I-Share catalog, click the 
<EM>Create new account</EM>&nbsp;link. For more information on creating an account in the
VuFind catalog, see 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>How to
Create a VuFind Account</FONT></U>.&nbsp;
<BR> 
[Login or Create new I-Share Account]</LI>
<LI>On the next screen you will see that the system randomly selects an available copy. Here you
can select the pick-up library (this will default to the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign) as well as which library on campus you would like the book sent to.&nbsp;By
default, it will be sent to the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Central Access Services</FONT></U> desk on
the 2nd floor of the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Main Library</FONT></U>. (If
you are a faculty member or graduate student, you can also select "Illinois Campus Mail" to have
the book sent to your office address.)
<BR> 
[Complete I-Share Request]</LI>
<LI>Click 
<EM>Request</EM>.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Books usually take about 7-10 days to arrive, and you will receive an email at your Illinois.edu
address when your request is available for pickup. This service is free for Illinois students and
staff.</P>
<H3>3. INTERLIBRARY LOAN: REQUESTING A BOOK NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH I-SHARE</H3>
<P>In rare cases, you won't be able to find a book in either the Illinois catalog or the I-Share
catalog. When this happens, you can request the book through 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan</FONT></U>. 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue></FONT></U></P>
<P>&gt;&gt; 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Watch a video</FONT></U> on how to request materials through Interlibrary Loan.</P>
<P>There are two methods for placing interlibrary loan requests:</P>
<H4>WorldCat requests</H4>
<P>You can place interlibrary loan requests directly through 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>WorldCat</FONT></U>,
a shared catalog for thousands of libraries throughout the world. Once you locate the item you need
in WorldCat, click the 
<EM>Request a Loan</EM> link:</P>
<P>
[The Request a Loan link in WorldCat]
</P>
<P>You'll then be prompted to enter your 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>NetID and
Active Directory password</FONT></U>. A form will pop up with all the details for the book already filled
in; just click 
<EM>Submit Request to ILLiad</EM>.</P>
<H4>Interlibrary Loan Book Request Form</H4>
<P>You can also request books by filling out a form on the 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Interlibrary Loan</FONT></U> page.
From the main page, click 
<EM>Login to My Account</EM>:</P>
<P>
[Login to your ILLiad account]
</P>
<P>You'll then be prompted for your 
<U><FONT COLOR=blue>NetID and
Active Directory password</FONT></U>. Every student and faculty member has an ILLiad account set up for
them, you only need to login. On the next screen, click 
<EM>Request a Book</EM> and fill in the necessary details.</P>
<P>Important things to know about interlibrary loan requests:</P>

<LI>Items usually take 2-3 weeks to arrive, so plan ahead!</LI>
<LI>You'll receive an email with a pickup location when the item is available.</LI>
<LI>This service is free for Illinois students and staff.</LI>
<LI>Interlibrary Loan cannot obtain course textbooks. (If you need to use a textbook, please check

<U><FONT COLOR=blue>Media and
