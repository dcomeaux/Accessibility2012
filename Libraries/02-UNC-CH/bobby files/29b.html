			UNC's copyright policy states that students hold the copyright to the 
            academic works they create, such as their papers, projects, theses, and 
            dissertations with the exception of cases outlined in the University's 
            copyright policy (sponsored or externally contracted work, works for hire, 
            and works authored by faculty members with assistance from a student).  
            Rights in the work include the right to publish, reproduce, distribute, 
            publicly perform or display the work.

          <P>            There are also privacy concerns related to the use of student work.  
            If faculty wish to distribute student work beyond the semester in which 
            the student is enrolled in a course, they are encouraged to ask for 
            permission as a professional courtesy.   As appropriate, the student should 
            have the opportunity to request that identifying information be removed or 
            that it be used with proper attribution.   If faculty members wish to 
            obtain permission in writing they can use

            <U><FONT COLOR=blue>What
            is protected</FONT></U><BR>
            Copyright protects an author's original work that is
            captured in a tangible medium of expression. Films,
            photographs, novels, plays, architectural drawings,
            software and original selections and arrangements of
            otherwise uncopyrighted materal (such as an anthology
            of public domain poetry) are examples of works
            protected by copyright.

          <LI>
            <U><FONT COLOR=blue>What
            isn't protected</FONT></U><BR>
            Some materials, such as general ideas, facts and
            federal government documents are not protected by
            copyright. Many other items are not protected by
            copyright because the term of protection has expired.
            Any work first published in the United States before
            1923 is no longer protected by copyright and may be
            used freely as part of the public domain.
