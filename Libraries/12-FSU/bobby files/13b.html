                <P>Carrels are available at Strozier Library and Dirac Science Library for FSU   faculty and graduate students who are using library materials for research and   writing.  Due to limited space, carrels are available on a first-come,   first-served basis to the following groups with validated FSU   Identification:</P>
                <UL>
                  <LI>Full-time FSU faculty</LI>
                  <LI>Enrolled Ph.D. students conducting writing and research (e.g. dissertation)   with their major professor’s signature approval.</LI>
                  <LI>Enrolled Masters students with their major professor’s signature will be   considered if carrels are available.  </LI>
                </UL>
                <P>At Dirac Science Library, priority will be given to students using Dirac   Science materials.  Renewals and extensions will be considered on an individual   basis.</P>
                <P>Strozier carrel applications may be turned in to the Faculty and Graduate   Research Services Office in Room 007 Monday through Friday, from 8:00am to   5:00pm.  Dirac Science Library carrel forms may be turned in at the circulation   desk Monday through Friday, 8:00am to 4:30pm only.</P>
                <P>Carrel assignments are limited to two semesters with one renewal allowed,   provided there is no waiting list.  As a courtesy to library patrons and as a   protection of library resources and services, the following regulations have   been established:</P>
                <P>1.  The following are prohibited in carrels:</P>
                <UL>
                  <LI>Using cell phones.</LI>
                  <LI>Smoking or using tobacco products.</LI>
                  <LI>Food or chewing gum</LI>
                  <LI>Beverages which are not in covered, spill-proof, reusable containers.</LI>
                  <LI>Library materials that are not charged out.</LI>
                  <LI>Placing materials on the window sills.</LI>
                  <LI>Covering door windows.</LI>
                  <LI>Using printers.</LI>
                  <LI>Furniture taken from other locations in the library.</LI>
                  <LI>Taping, gluing or attaching items to the walls or windows.              </LI>
                </UL>
                <P>2.  A paging service is not provided.</P>
                <P>3.  Only the individual assigned to the carrel is permitted to use the   carrel.</P>
                <P>4.  Library research or writing is the intended purposes of the carrels.    Carrels are quiet study areas and are not intended to serve as an office.  </P>
                <P>5.  Carrel users are responsible for being aware of the library’s hours and   vacating their carrel 15 minutes before closing.  Library hours can be viewed at <U><FONT COLOR=blue><EM>http://www.lib.fsu.edu/hours</EM></FONT></U><EM>.</EM></P>
                <P>The carrel user is responsible for the carrel key.  He or she must   immediately file a report with the FSU Police for a lost or stolen key.  The   carrel user will then take the police report to the appropriate carrel   coordinator who will then email the FSU key shop coordinator with the police   report number, the user’s FSU card number, the user’s email address, and the   carrel number.  The carrel coordinator will have the FSU Key Office reissue a   key.  The user may then pick up the key from the appropriate carrel coordinator   after 48 hours.  The user may be required to pay the replacement cost of the   key.  If a carrel user fails to replace a lost or stolen key or to surrender a   key at the end of the assigned period, the library may request that the   university withhold all official records.</P>
                <P>A pattern of violations of these regulations may result in forfeiture of the   carrel.  Carrels may be regularly inspected and are subject to being checked at   any time.  Leaving personal property in carrels is discouraged and will be at   owner’s risk.  The University Libraries are not responsible for personal   property left in the carrels. </P>

                <P>Strozier Library welcomes students, faculty and staff to bring food and drink   into the library with the exception of designated areas. Aromatic foods such as   pizza, popcorn, etc. should be eaten in the main floor lobby area so as not to   disturb others. Drinks should have a lid to help contain liquids in case of   tipping over. To continue to provide a safe and clean environment, we ask that   all containers and residue be discarded after consumption.</P>
