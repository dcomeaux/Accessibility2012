			<H2>About Library</H2>
			<P>[INLINE]The mission of the libraries at North Carolina Central University 
                is to provide resources and services which support the University's 
                educational, research, cultural and public service objectives. Library 
                  resources at North Carolina Central University are located in the 
                James E. Shepard Memorial Library, the</P>			<P> Music Library, the Library 
                      of the School of Library and Information Sciences, and the Library 
                      of the School of Law. These libraries contain a total of over 850,000 
                      volumes, and subscribe to approximately 5000 periodicals. Access 
                      to these collections is provided by an integrated online catalog 
                      and circulation system.<BR>
                <BR>
                In 1994 NCCU became a member of the Triangle Research Libraries 
          Network (TRLN). TRLN is a cooperative comprised of libraries at 
          Duke University, NCCU, UNC at Chapel Hill, and NC State University 
          with combined collections of over 10 million volumes. NCCU students 
          and faculty can borrow directly from other TRLN institutions as 
          well as from the remaining constituent institutions of the University 
          of North Carolina System. <BR>
                <BR>
                The James E. Shepard Memorial Library contains 500,597 volumes and 
                140,200 federal and state documents. Periodical subscriptions total 
                1928. Several microform collections and an extensive inventory of 
                full-text electronic databases are among the library's non-print 
                resources. Some of the electronic databases are remotely accessible. <BR>
                <BR>
                In 1950, the library acquired the Martin Collection of books and 
                pamphlets on African American history, literature and culture. Many 
                of the titles and editions found in the famous Schomburg Collection 
                are duplicated in the outstanding Martin Collection. <BR>
                Textbooks, curriculum guides, and non -print items in the field 
                of education are housed in the Curriculum Materials Center (CMC). 
                Videocassettes and audiotapes are also part of the CMC collection. <BR>
                <BR>
                The Music Library, located on the third floor of the Edwards Music 
                Building, contains an excellent collection of instrumental and vocal 
                music, orchestral scores and records, in addition to carefully selected 
                books in the field of music. The Music Library is a branch of the 
                Shepard Library. <BR>
                Since its construction in 1950 at the center of the campus, the 
                Shepard Library has served as the primary resource for teaching, 
                research and scholarship at NCCU. A major expansion of the building 
                in 1976 increased the total number of square feet to 104,364. In 
                2001, Information Technology Services designated the Library as 
                the location for the main student computer laboratory. Wireless 
                technology provides Internet access throughout the facility. <BR>
                Although changes have occurred in the library environment with the 
                appearance of new formats and emerging technologies, traditional 
                values of helpful, supportive, individualized service remain firmly 
                entrenched in the culture of the libraries at NCCU.
