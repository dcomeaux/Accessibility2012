              <P>The Acquisitions Department of James E. Shepard Memorial Library is responsible for acquiring print and non-print materials for the library.</P>
              <P>The Acquisitions Department acknowledges all the materials purchased for the library will support the mission of the university, needs of specific courses, or issues important to the education of the students at North Carolina Central University.</P>
              <P>  Book Budget</P>
              <P>Department book budget amounts are determined by the Director of Library Services and are based on past acquisition history and requests submitted annually by the departments. Materials/books will be ordered until all departmental budget funds are expended.</P>
              <P>Funds may be used for the purchase of print, non-print, electronic databases and videos, etc. However, it is the policy of the library to use book budget funds primarily for the purchase of books. This is to ensure that the library is providing the best selection of current information in print.</P>
              <P> Request Forms</P>
              <P>Request forms are accepted from library liaison, faculty, staff, and students to acquire materials in varied formats. Recommendations from the faculty have a top priority in the selection of materials in their disciplines. Staff and student suggested resources must support the curriculum and the collection development policy. All request forms are given to the Acquisitions Department for consideration.</P>
              <P>When there is a choice between paper bound and cloth bound editions, acquisitions will order the cloth bound. Prior to an order being placed, the library will explore return polices with the distributor. All materials/books will be processed as received and original request forms will be sent back to the department that initiated the request.</P>
              <P> Periodicals</P>
              <P>Ordering new periodicals is the responsibility of the Serials Librarian. A new periodical should not duplicate an item that is currently available in James E. Shepard Memorial Library either in print or online.</P>
              <P>The library staff and each department will evaluate all continuations on a periodic basis to determine the appropriateness, currency, and the value of each title to the overall collection development policies of the library.</P>
              <P> Reference Materials </P>
              <P>Ordering reference materials is the responsibility of the Reference Library. This recommendation may be based on professional judgment and/or in consultation with faculty.</P>
              <P> Gifts</P>
              <P>It is the policy of James E. Shepard Memorial Library to gratefully accept donations of materials as long as the donor understands that the library professional staff reserves the right to determine the usefulness of each item to our collection. The library staff must be free to add the books to the collection if desirable or discard them, as they deem appropriate.</P>
              <P>The library does not establish a value for items donated. The donor, in consultation with his/her tax advisor or lawyer, must establish a value for income purposes.</P>
              <P>Our policy is to acknowledge receipt of gifts without establishing a value for items donated. It is our policy to send a gift thank you letter.</P>

              <P>All circulating materials are subject to recall for other patrons and for faculty members who need to place items on reserve. Reserve requests are recalled immediately.</P>
              <P> Renewals</P>
              <P>Checked-out books may be renewed, provided they are not recalled by another patron or needed to be placed on reserve in CMC. Renewals can be done in person, by telephone by calling 919-530-6383, or by email to the CMC Assistant/Librarian. A patron renewing an overdue book will be charged and held responsible for the overdue fee. Videotapes, CDs, and DVDs cannot be renewed. </P>
              <P> Returning Materials </P>
              <P>During normal operating hours, all checked out materials must be returned to the front desk in CMC Room 1024. Books may be dropped after hours, on holidays, or on the weekends in the drop box located at the front entrance of the School of Education. Non-print materials such as films, CDs, DVDs, and kits should be returned directly to CMC. Any damage to CMC materials will be subject to replacement fees. </P>
              <P>Patrons are responsible for returning all CMC materials on or before the due date. Returning materials to the wrong location can create an overdue fine and the patron will still be accountable. CMC Materials should not be returned at Shepard Library.</P>
              <P> Putting Non-Book Materials on Reserve</P>
              <P>NCCU faculty is asked to send CMC their lists of required and supplementary non-book reserve materials one week prior to the start of any semester. CMC further requests that faculty observe the following:</P>
              <P>1. Materials are put on reserve prior to making class assignments by completing a form designated for the purpose.</P>
              <P>2. In order to abide by copyright laws, CMC will not place on reserve any copies of videocassettes or other non-print materials which faculty may have made from originals.</P>
              <P>3. CMC can place on reserve any non-print materials in its collection. Original materials owned by faculty can also be placed on reserve, with the understanding that CMC takes no responsibility for any damage or loss which may result by use.</P>
              <P>4. Faculty needs to make a decision about the loan period for non-print reserve items. For example, should the designated materials be used within CMC for a set period or hours or could they be checked out overnight. CMC materials designated as &ldquo;For Use in Library Only&rdquo; will not be checked out.</P>
              <P>5. All materials put on reserve for a particular semester are to be removed from reserve at the end of that same semester.</P>
              <P>6. Students must be made aware of CMC&rsquo;s normal operating hours. They may view films or use other non-print reserve items during those normal operating hours. Group viewing should be scheduled ahead of time by reserving the CMC Area 3 or CMC viewing room;</P>
              <P>7. Due to space constraints within CMC, no more than 10 students can watch a video at one time.</P>
              <P> Video/DVD Film Reservations for Classroom Showing</P>
              <P>NCCU Faculty may reserve videocassettes, DVDs, and CDs for classroom showing. Reservations must be made a week prior to classroom showing and must be returned promptly to the CMC after their use.</P>
              <P> Interlibrary Loan Services</P>
              <P>Through the CMC , NCCU faculty, graduate students and staff can borrow videocassettes /DVDs from other TRLN libraries after filling out an appropriate form and submitting it to the CMC Director. NCCU patrons wishing to borrow books from other libraries can do so through Shepard Library&rsquo;s Interlibrary Loan services based in the Reference Department.</P>
              <P> Lamination Services</P>
              <P>University faculty, staff and students may have class-related materials laminated free of charge. Forms for lamination services should be completed and submitted to CMC at least a day prior to their need for the materials. CMC staff performs the lamination themselves and contacts patrons when materials are ready.</P>
              <P> CMC Equipment Use</P>
              <P>The CMC houses a variety of equipment &ndash; four computers, one laser printer, twenty laptop computers on cart, one overhead projector, one slide projector, one audiocassette and CD player/recorder, TV/VCR combination on wheeled cart, one TV/VCR as wall unit in the CMC area3, DVD player, laminating machine, paper cutter, and more. All such equipment is for in-house use only.<EM></EM>The equipment is intended for academic purposes. Any patron&rsquo;s personal videocassettes, DVD or recordings may not be played on the CMC equipment.</P>
              <P> CMC Area Use for Workshops, Meetings, and Training Sessions </P>
              <P>The CMC Area 3 is available for reservation by School of Education faculty and staff who wish to conduct a workshop and/or offer a training session during weekdays. It is encouraged that noise level should be kept low during the session. Also, consumption of any food or drink is not allowed in the CMC. Completing a reservation form is required for reserving the CMC Area 3.</P>
              <P>The CMC Area 3 may be booked at least two weeks in advance of the proposed event. Reservations are guaranteed only for the pre-reserved date(s). In case of immediate need, please call CMC Director at the Ext. 6383 or send an email. The CMC must be notified of any cancellations at least 48 hours in advance of the scheduled event. All reservations will be confirmed within 24 hours. </P>

              <P><EM>Making Requests </EM></P>
              <P>ILL services are provided to all NCCU faculty, students and staff with current enrollment or employment. All interlibrary loan requests must be submitted electronically from the Library&rsquo;s Web site. This form allows staff to electronically transfer the needed information to the lending libraries, which cuts processing time and minimizes errors. Telephone or e-mail requests are not accepted.</P>
              <P><EM> Requirements for ILL Requests : </EM></P>
              <UL>

              <P><EM> Turnaround Time </EM></P>
              <P>ILL requests are processed as quickly as possible. It is the goal of the ILL staff to place a request within 24 hours after submission, but this may not be possible during high volume periods of the academic year. ILL materials can take 2-3 weeks to arrive.</P>

              <P>If materials are not claimed within 10 days of the first notification, ILL staff will attempt to contact the requester again by e-mail. It is the patron&rsquo;s responsibility to activate their NCCU account and to check for arrival notices, as well as provide a current mailing address. If the item is not picked up on time, the patron has lost that time with the item. Since renewals are at the lending institution&rsquo;s discretion, a renewal cannot be guaranteed.</P>

              <P><EM> Fines </EM></P>
              <P>A $1.00 per day (no maximum) fine is charged for overdue materials. Materials that have been recalled because they are overdue will be charged $5.00 per day (no maximum) fee. These provisions are applicable to all individuals using interlibrary loan services.</P>
              <P>Lost/Damaged Books: students and faculty are charged the replacement cost for lost or damaged materials. The replacement cost is determined by the lending library.</P>

              <P><EM> Unclaimed Materials </EM></P>
              <P>If an item is unclaimed and/or cannot be delivered due to the patron providing an incorrect mailing address, unclaimed materials will be returned to the lending library.</P>
