                record is in good standing (i.e. no overdue books, no outstanding 
                fines, etc.). the lending library will inform patrons of the method 
                of verification they are using. After verification, you will need

                You will need to provide your NCCU Borrower ID number and your 
                PIN number. (Your borrower ID is your BANNER # and your PIN is the number provided to you by your home library), You may obtain your PIN number at any time by contacting the Circulation Department at 919-530-6426. <BR>
                <BR>
                <EM>Expiration of Privilege</EM><BR>
                Eligibility for borrowing will be verified and borrowing privileges 
                renewed on a regular schedule. Students privileges will expire 
                on August 15. Faculty and staff privileges will 
                expire annually on December 15. Borrowing privileges must be renewed 
                the first time an NCCU borrower uses a member library after the 
                date of expiration.<BR>

                NCCU students requesting borrowing privileges at a participating 
                library must present a valid NCCU student ID card along with another 
                form of photo ID.<BR>

                Eligible participants in this program include faculty, students 
                and staff who can be identified in their home library&#8217;s patron 
                database. Once the patron has been determined to be eligible to 
                borrow library materials, the lending library is responsible for 
                registering the borrower in its own database as a ULAC Cooperative 
                Borrower. Policies governing the ULAC Cooperative Borrowers are 
                to be determined by the lending library.<BR>
                <BR>
                <EM>Library privileges</EM><BR>
                Privileges shall include book stack access and home-use borrowing. 
                All materials borrowed shall be subject to the ULAC Cooperative 
                Borrower patron guidelines of the lending library. All loan procedures 
                and all charges assessed the cooperative user for overdue books, 
                lost books, or damaged materials shall also be based on the policies 
                of the lending library.<BR>
                <BR>
                The lending library reserves the right to refuse borrowing and 
                  building-use privileges to any individual who violates the regulations 
                  of that library. Any library may deny cooperative borrowing privileges 
                  to any prospective borrower who is delinquent at his or her library 
                  or in any of the cooperating libraries. All fines and charges 
                  are the sole responsibility of the visiting borrower, not their 
                  home institution. Unpaid fines or charges will be forwarded to 
                  the visiting borrower&#8217;s home institution and applied to 
                  the borrower&#8217;s account there.              </P>
